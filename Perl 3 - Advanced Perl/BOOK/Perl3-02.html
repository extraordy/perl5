 <p>Welcome back to your <i>Advanced Perl</i> course! In this lesson we'll learn about two special Perl operators 
  that test properties of files.</p>
 
 
 <a href="Perl3-02.html" name="filetestoperators"></a>
 <a name="h_01"></a><div class="heading">File Test Operators</div><div class="headingText">
   
  <p>Each file has specific properties that you may need to know, like how old it is, or whether
   it's a directory (folder). Perl has a few different operators that can provide that information. Let's take a look at 
   those. In your <b>/perl3</b> folder, create a program named <span class="darkred">filetest.pl</span>, then type in  the code 
   as shown:</p>
   
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE:</div><div class="listing"><pre>#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

my $file = shift || $0;
print "$file exists\n"              if -e $file;
print "$file is a regular file\n"   if -f $file;
print "$file is a directory\n"      if -d $file;
print "$file is a symbolic link\n"  if -l $file;
print "$file is empty\n"            if -z $file;
my $size = -s $file;
print "$file has size $size\n"      if $size;
my $old = -M $file;
print "$file is $old days old\n"    if defined $old;
print "$file is readable\n"         if -r $file;
print "$file is executable\n"       if -x $file;
print "$file is special\n"          if -b $file || -c $file;
</pre></div></div>
   
  <p>You can run this program with any filename as its argument; if you don't give it an argument, it will test
   itself.  Type the following commands in the Terminal window:</p>
   
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>
cold:~$ <ins>cd perl3</ins>
cold:~/perl3$ <ins>./filetest.pl</ins>
./filetest.pl exists
./filetest.pl is a regular file
./filetest.pl has size 591
./filetest.pl is 0.0028587962962963 days old
./filetest.pl is readable
./filetest.pl is executable
</pre></div></div>
  
  <p>Here's how this program works. Each file test operator appears to be a minus sign (<b>-</b>) followed by a letter.
    That may seem weird, like there's some kind of subtraction going onâ€”there isn't.</p>
   
  <p><div class="c"><table class="noteBox fBox pBox "><tr><td class="noteTitle">Note</td><td class="note">This syntax was chosen to match the syntax used in the Bourne and C shells. The creators of Perl wanted  
   users of earlier languages to be able to learn Perl quickly, so they incorporated many of their features.</td></tr></table></div></p>
   
  <p>There are several additional file test operators in Perl than are shown in that program; you can get a complete 
   list of them by typing <b>perldoc -f -X</b>. Here are the test operators that we used in <b>filetest.pl</b>:</p>
   
  <div class="c"><table class="tbl" border=""><tr><th>Operator</th><th>Meaning</th></tr><tr><td>-e</td><td>Does file exist?</td></tr><tr><td>-f</td><td>Is file a regular file?</td></tr><tr><td>-d</td><td>Is file a directory?</td></tr><tr><td>-l</td><td>Is file a symbolic link?</td></tr><tr><td>-z</td><td>Is file zero length (empty)?</td></tr><tr><td>-s</td><td>How big is file (in bytes)?</td></tr><tr><td>-M</td><td>How old is file (in days)?</td></tr><tr><td>-r</td><td>Is file readable (by current process)?</td></tr><tr><td>-x</td><td>Is file executable (by current process)?</td></tr><tr><td>-b</td><td>Is file a block special file?</td></tr><tr><td>-c</td><td>Is file a character special file?</td></tr></table></div>
   
  <p>All of these operators are boolean (return a true or false result), except for <b>-s</b> and <b>-M</b>, 
   which return integer and floating point numbers, respectively. Of course, you can also use the <b>-s</b> 
   operator in a boolean context to mean, "does the file have any contents?"</p>
   
  <p>Type the commands below to try out a couple more invocations of the program:</p>
   
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>
cold:~/perl3$ <ins>./filetest.pl .</ins>
cold:~/perl3$ <ins>./filetest.pl /dev/tty</ins>
</pre></div></div>
   
  <p>What other files can you find on the system that will produce different results? What happens if you run 
   the program on a file that doesn't exist? </p>
   
  <p>The operators take a filename as argument; if you don't supply one, then they'll use <span class="red">$_</span> by 
   default. As of Perl version 5.10, it's possible to chain or stack multiple operators together as a 
   shorthand way to "AND" them together logically. Modify <span class="darkred">filetest.pl</span> as shown:</p>
   
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE:</div><div class="listing"><pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

my $file = shift || $0;
print "$file exists\n"              if -e $file;
print "$file is a regular file\n"   if -f $file;
print "$file is a directory\n"      if -d $file;
print "$file is a symbolic link\n"  if -l $file;
print "$file is empty\n"            if -z $file;
my $size = -s $file;
print "$file has size $size\n"      if $size;
my $old = -M $file;
print "$file is $old days old\n"    if defined $old;
print "$file is readable\n"         if -r $file;
print "$file is executable\n"       if -x $file;
print "$file is special\n"          if -b $file || -c $file;
<ins>print "Perl version is $]\n";
if ( $] &gt;= 5.010 )
{
  print "$file is text, writable (chaining is allowed)\n" if -w -T $file;
}
else
{
  print "$file is text, writable (chaining is not allowed)\n" if -w $file &amp;&amp; -T $file;
}</ins>
</pre></div></div>
   
  <p>Here (for Perl version 5.010 or later) we've stacked the two tests <b>-w</b> and <b>-T</b>:</p>
     
  <div class="c"><table class="tbl" border=""><tr><th>Operator</th><th>Meaning</th></tr><tr><td>-w</td><td>Is file writeable (by current process)?</td></tr><tr><td>-T</td><td>Is file text (as opposed to binary)?</td></tr></table></div>
   
  <p>This form of stacking is more efficient than using <b>-w $file &amp;&amp; -T $file</b>, as you would 
   have had to do in versions of Perl prior to 5.10. We used the special variable <span class="red">$]</span>, which 
   contains Perl's version number. The code varies according to which version 
   of Perl is running.</p>
  
  <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it to see which version of Perl we're 
   using.</p>
 
 </div>
 <a href="Perl3-02.html" name="statfunction"></a>
 <a name="h_02"></a><div class="heading">The stat Function</div><div class="headingText">
   
  <p>The file test 
   operators don't tell you everything you want to know about a file though; for example, you may need to know who owns it. 
   That information (and more) is provided by the built-in function 
   <span class="darkgreen">stat()</span>: </p>
   
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: stat()</div><div class="observe"><pre>
($dev,$ino,$mode,$nlink,$uid,$gid,$rdev,$size,$atime,$mtime,$ctime,$blksize,$blocks) = stat($filename)
</pre></div></div>
   
  <p>This table contains definitions for the elements in that list:</p>
   
  <div class="c"><table class="tbl" border=""><tr><th>Index in list above</th><th>Variable in list above</th><th>Meaning</th></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>$dev</td><td>device number of filesystem</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>$ino</td><td>inode number</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>$mode</td><td>file mode  (type and permissions)</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>$nlink</td><td>number of (hard) links to the file</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>$uid</td><td>numeric user ID of file's owner</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>$gid</td><td>numeric group ID of file's owner</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>$rdev</td><td>the device identifier (special files only)</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>$size</td><td>total size of file, in bytes</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>$atime</td><td>last access time in seconds since the epoch</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>$mtime</td><td>last modify time in seconds since the epoch</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>$ctime</td><td>inode change time in seconds since the epoch (*)</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>$blksize</td><td>preferred block size for file system I/O</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>$blocks</td><td>actual number of blocks allocated</td></tr></table></div>
   
  <p>Most of this information is esoteric and rarely useful. 
   <span class="darkgreen">stat()</span> returns all of 
   the information that the system call of the same name provides. (Keep in mind that on some operating systems, some of the 
   information you see in the table is not available.) The attributes that are most often useful are the file mode, its owner, and 
   the time a file was last modified. (The size is also useful, but you can get that information more directly by using the <b>-s</b> 
   operator.) Let's see those more useful elements in action. Create a new file named <span class="darkred">stat.pl</span> as shown:</p>
   
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE:</div><div class="listing"><pre>#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

my $file = shift || $0;
my ($mode, $uid, $mtime) = (stat $file)[2,4,9];
printf "Mode of %s is %o\n", $file, $mode;
print "UID owning $file is $uid\n";
print "Modification time of $file is $mtime\n";
</pre></div></div>
   
  <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it as shown below:</p>
  
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>
cold:~/perl3$  <ins>./stat.pl</ins>
Mode of ./stat.pl is 100755
UID owning ./stat.pl is 16948
Modification time of ./stat.pl is 1285169770
</pre></div></div>
   
  <p>Do you see how we used the list slice <b>[2,4,9]</b> to retrieve only the elements we want? (Referring to the indices 
   in the table above is helpful here. You can get the same table using <b>perldoc -f stat</b>.)</p>
    
  <p>The times returned by <span class="darkgreen">stat()</span> are in seconds since midnight, January 1, 1970 (the 
   "epoch"). This is the same time reference that is returned by the <span class="darkgreen">time()</span> function 
   and accepted by the <span class="darkgreen">localtime()</span> function. Now let's make the output more 
   user-friendly. Modify your code as shown by adding the <ins>blue</ins> code and removing the <del>red</del> code as shown:</p>
   
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE:</div><div class="listing"><pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

my $file = shift || $0;
my ($mode, $uid, $mtime) = (stat $file)[2,4,9];
printf "Mode of %s is %o\n", $file, $mode;
print "UID owning $file is $uid\n";
<del>print "Modification time of $file is $mtime\n";</del>
<ins>print "Modification time of $file is " . localtime( $mtime ) . "\n";</ins>
</pre></div></div>
   
  <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it as shown:</p>

<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>
cold:~/perl3$ <ins>./stat.pl</ins>
Mode of ./stat.pl is 100755
UID owning ./stat.pl is 16948
Modification time of ./stat.pl is Wed Sep 22 10:58:09 2010
</pre></div></div>
   
  <p>You get these results because we used <span class="darkgreen">localtime()</span> in a scalar context.</p> 
  
  <p>The UID (user ID) is numeric. But having the name of that UID would probably be more useful. We can get that with the 
   <span class="darkgreen">getpwuid()</span> built-in function. Modify your code as shown: </p>
   
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE:</div><div class="listing"><pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

my $file = shift || $0;
my ($mode, $uid, $mtime) = (stat $file)[2,4,9];
printf "Mode of %s is %o\n", $file, $mode;
<del>print "UID owning $file is $uid\n";</del>
<ins>my $owner = getpwuid $uid;
print "Owner of $file is $owner\n";</ins>
print "Modification time of $file is " . localtime( $mtime ) . "\n";
</pre></div></div>
   
  <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it as shown here:</p>

<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>
cold:~/perl3$ <ins>./stat.pl</ins>
Mode of ./stat.pl is 100755
Owner of ./stat.pl is smiller
Modification time of ./stat.pl is Wed Sep 22 11:34:07 2010
cold:~/perl3$ 
</pre></div></div>
   
  <p>So why does the mode of this file display as 100755? Hmm. Run <b>ls -l</b> on the file as shown:</p>
   
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>
cold:~/perl3$ <ins>ls -l ./stat.pl</ins>
-rwxr-xr-x 1 smiller webusers 290 Sep 22 11:34 <span class="green">./stat.pl</span>
</pre></div></div>
    
  <p>We get a result of <b>-rwxr-xr-x</b>, which is 755. The answer to our earlier question lies in that almost invisible minus sign at
   the beginning of the <b>ls</b> output.  It indicates which <i>type</i> of file we have. In this case, it's a regular file;
   other possibilities include <b>d</b> for a directory, <b>l</b> for a symbolic link, and so on.  
   The information regarding type is included in <b>$mode</b>. The 1000000 bit corresponds to a regular file. Just try 
   running <span class="darkred">stat.pl</span> on a directory!</p>
     
  <p>Let's try a file example for fun. Create a new file named <span class="darkred">oldest.pl</span> in the <b>/perl3</b> folder:</p>
  
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE:</div><div class="listing"><pre>#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

my $dir = shift || '.';
opendir my $dh, $dir or die "opendir $dir: $!\n";
my %age;
while ( my $file = readdir $dh )
{
  next if $file =~ /\A\.\.?\z/;
  $age{$file} = -M "$dir/$file";
}

print "The oldest 50% of files are:\n";
my $index = 0;
for my $file ( sort { $age{$b} &lt;=&gt; $age{$a} } keys %age )
{
  print "$file ($age{$file} days)\n";
  $index++; 
  last if $index &gt;= (keys %age) / 2;
}
</pre></div></div>
  
  <p>This program prints the names of the older half of the files in the given directory (or the current 
   directory, by default). Now let's run it on <b>/etc</b>:</p>
  
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>
cold:~/perl3$  <ins>./oldest.pl /etc</ins>
The oldest 50% of files are:
urlview.conf (3716.21444444444 days)
rpc (3294.24068287037 days)
quotatab (3222.75721064815 days)
minicom.users (2716.80438657407 days)
nsswitch.conf (2174.5394212963 days)
<i>[...etc...]</i>
</pre></div></div>
  
  <p>Read the program carefully and make sure you understand how it works, then experiment with it!</p>
  <p>Once you feel confident with these properties of files, you're ready to move on to the next lesson where 
  we'll tackle interacting with the operating system!</p>
  
 </div>
  
 <p>When you finish this lesson, complete the homework from your syllabus.</p>
