 <p>Welcome back to your Advanced Perl course! Can you believe it? We're already past the halfway point in the course.

 <a href="Perl3-09.html" name="arrow_operator"></a>
 <a name="h_01"></a><div class="heading">The Arrow Operator</div><div class="headingText">
   
  <p>If you find some of the expressions involving references complicated, you're not alone. It can still be pretty challenging 
    even after you know how to construct or read an expression like:
    
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE:</div><div class="observe"><pre>${ $refs[1] }{ $$alt_furn_ref[2] }</pre></div></div>
    
    Fortunately, there's the <b>arrow operator</b>:  <span class="code"><b>-&gt;</b></span>. 
   The arrow operator 
   makes more complex code easier to read.
 It's a <i>binary infix</i> operator, which means it operates on two things, one to its left and one 
   to its right (<b>+</b> is another such operator):</p>
   
  <p><div class="c"><span class="code"><i>LEFT</i><b>-&gt;</b><i>RIGHT</i></span></div></p>
   
  <p>The operation it performs depends on what's on the <i>right</i> side. The arrow operator is used for several 
   purposes; first we'll see how the arrow operator 
   <i>accesses members of aggregates pointed to by references</i>.</p>
   
   <p>That means we can use it to get at an element of an array, given an array ref, or an element of
    a hash, given a hash ref. Let's try an example. Create <b>arrow.pl</b> in 
   your <b>/perl3</b> folder as shown:</p>
   
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE:</div><div class="listing"><pre>#!/usr/bin/perl

my @clouds = qw(cumulus nimbus cumulonimbus stratus cirrus);
my $clouds_ref = \@clouds;

print "Cloud types:\n";
print "\t $clouds_ref-&gt;[$_]\n" for 0 .. $#$clouds_ref;

# http://www.navy.mil/navydata/questions/bells.html
my %mid_bells = ( one =&gt; '0030', two =&gt; '0100', three =&gt; '0130', four =&gt; '0200',
                  five =&gt; '0230', six =&gt; '0300', seven =&gt; '0330', eight =&gt; '0400' );
my $mid_ref = \%mid_bells;
print "Fourth mid bell is at $mid_ref-&gt;{four}\n";
</pre></div></div>
   
  <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it by typing the commands below as shown:</p>
 
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~$ <ins>cd perl3</ins>

Fourth mid bell is at 0200
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p>In the above example the arrow operator works with curly braces.
    When using the arrow operator, if the right side consists of curly braces around an expression, then the right side is interpreted as 
     braces around a hash key, the left side must be a reference to a hash, and the result is the element with that 
     key in the hash pointed to by the reference.</p>
   
  <p>Now we'll use the arrow operator with square brackets to improve the readability of an earlier program. 
     When using the arrow operator, if the right side consists of square brackets around an expression, then the right side is interpreted 
      as brackets around an array index, the left side must be a reference to an array, and the result is 
      the element at that index of the array pointed to by the reference.</p>
   <p> Go to 
    your <b>/perl3</b> folder, open 
   <b>ref_rules.pl</b> and modify it as shown:</p>
  
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE:</div><div class="listing"><pre>#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

my $furn_ref = [ qw(sofa chair loveseat piano credenza) ];
my $cost_ref = { sofa =&gt; 1500, chair =&gt; 300, loveseat =&gt; 800, piano =&gt; 6000, credenza =&gt; 500 };

# Rule 1
print "Cost of third item from \$furn_ref is: ",
      <del>$$cost_ref{ $$furn_ref[2] },</del>
      <ins>$cost_ref-&gt;{ $furn_ref-&gt;[2] },</ins>
      "\n";

# Rule 2
my $alt_furn_ref = [ qw(bed rug rocker stool) ];
my $alt_cost_ref = { bed =&gt; 3000, rug =&gt; 75, rocker =&gt; 450, stool =&gt; 125 };
my @refs = ( $cost_ref, $alt_cost_ref );

print "Cost of third item in \$alt_furn_ref from second reference in array is: ",
      <del>${ $refs[1] }{ $$alt_furn_ref[2] },</del>
      <ins>$refs[1]-&gt;{ $alt_furn_ref-&gt;[2] },</ins>
      "\n";
</pre></div></div>
   
  <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it.</p>
   <p>  The output will be the same as 
   before, only the code syntax has changed. </p>
   
  <p>We could change some of our other earlier programs in the same way. This code fragment:</p>
  
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: </div><div class="observe"><pre>
print "I have $$stock_ref{ants} ants\n";
</pre></div></div>
   
  <p>...could be replaced with this:</p>

<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: </div><div class="observe"><pre>
print "I have $stock_ref-&gt;{ants} ants\n";
</pre></div></div>
   
  <p>...because the arrow operator also works when interpolated in double-quoted strings.</p>
   
  <p>The arrow operator can only be used to get <i>elements</i> of an aggregate using a 
   reference, so there are still times that you'll need to use the dereferencing rules from the last lesson; if you want to access the whole
    aggregate, for instance, to get the keys of a hash.
   (You will see more uses of that in the next 
   few lessons.) But we'll use the arrow syntax from now on for all accesses of aggregate members.</p>
   
  <p>So, what happens if the reference doesn't point to the
   correct type of thing? Let's find out using this one-liner:</p>
   
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~/perl3$ <ins>perl -wle '$h_ref = { J =&gt; 10, Q =&gt; 10, K =&gt; 10 }; print $h_ref-&gt;[42]'</ins>
Not an ARRAY reference at -e line 1.
</pre></div></div>
  
  <p>That's a fatal run-time exception. The right side of the arrow operator has 
   square brackets, so it expects the left side to be a reference to an array.</p>
  
  <p>Let's do one more arrow operator example, this time using a possible solution to the Lesson 8 project. Create
   <b>hash_compare.pl</b> in your <b>/perl3</b> folder as shown:</p>
  
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE:</div><div class="listing"><pre>#!/usr/bin/perl

 <a name="h_02"></a><div class="heading">Lists of Lists</div><div class="headingText">
   
  <p>Time to dig into a vital topic that we call <i>Lists of Lists</i>. That's actually an 
   inaccurate term, because you can't have lists of lists in Perl; what we really mean is  
    "Aggregates containing references to other aggregates," where "aggregate" is an array or a hash, 
   but that's a pretty big mouthful, so we'll stick with "lists of lists." That term is 
   ingrained in Perl culture, and it's the title of the Perl document found through 
   <b>perldoc perllol</b>.</p>
  
  <a name="s_01"></a><div id="s_01"><div class="subheading">Multidimensional Arrays</div><div class="subheadingText">
   
   <p>Let's start our experimentation with a familiar entity: the two-dimensional array. Even if you've never programmed one 
    before, you have a sense of how it works if you've seen a chess 
    board. We'll work on a smaller scale first with the tic-tac-toe board ("noughts and crosses" as it's 
    called in some countries). The game is played on a 3x3 board and the first person to get three
    of their marks in a row in any direction wins:</p>

print_board( \@board );

sub print_board

  my $board_ref = shift;

   <p>Somehow <b>O</b> has managed to outwit <b>X</b>! Notice that we passed a reference to <b>@board</b> in order to
    <b>print_board</b>; we could have passed <b>@board</b> itself instead, as long as
    we wrote <b>print_board</b> to expect an array instead of an array ref. The programs you write will reflect your own
    subroutine interface design preferences.</p>
   
   <p>Our board has been represented as an array of references to arrays. If we designate positions on the 
    board according to the intersections of rows and columns numbered from 1 to 3, we 
    can then add code to indicate specific locations. (Remember that Perl's arrays are indexed from 
    zero, not one.) Let's give that a try. Modify <b>game.pl</b> as shown:</p>

   <p>Success! We changed the mark at the end of the middle row.</p>
   
   <p>Perl doesn't actually have a two-dimensional array as a proper type like 
    many languages do. Instead, Perl lets you put anything you want into a one-dimensional array, including 
    references to other one-dimensional arrays. An array that contains references to other arrays that 
    are all of the same size is functionally equivalent to a two-dimensional array; but nothing stops you 
    from changing that at any point during run-time. It's up to you to make sure the arrays are the correct size.</p>

   <p>Perl may not have real multidimensional arrays, but you can still benefit from their syntactical 
    advantages!  Make this slight modification to <b>game.pl</b>:</p>

   <p>That's right, remove the arrow. <img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it. 
    The results are unchanged. This is a nice piece of <i>syntactic sugar</i> from Perl:</p>

   <p><div class="c"><table class="noteBox fBox pBox "><tr><td class="noteTitle">Note</td><td class="note">When there are two pairs of subscripting brackets or braces separated by only an arrow, 
    the arrow can be omitted.</td></tr></table></div></p>
    
   <p>So, you could represent a 3-D structure with, say, an array <b>@cube</b> of references to 
    <i>references</i> to arrays. Then, addressing any cell in the cube would look like this: 
    <b>$cube[$x][$y][$z]</b>. As you saw in our example above, when we <i>iterate through</i> 
    or <i>traverse</i> a multidimensional structure, we usually extract each aggregate reference into a 
    separate scalar as we go, so that we expand the next level with code like <b>@$ref</b> and not, 
    for example, <b>@{ $cube[$x][$y] }</b>, which is harder to read.</p>

 <a name="h_03"></a><div class="heading">The Schwartzian Transform</div><div class="headingText">
  
  <p>I think you're ready to learn an elegant optimization for sorting certain lists. The 
   <i>Schwartzian Transform</i> is named after famed Perl guru, Randal Schwartz. It reduces the time 
   required for sorting. You only use it when you're pressed to save time sorting, but really, you'd save even 
   more time by using a CPAN module like Sort::Maker with the 
   Guttman-Rosler Transform. In any case, you don't want to get into anything that complicated unless 
   it's absolutely necessary.</p>
  
  <p>So then, if this isn't the preferred way to sort, why am I showing it to you?  Because the Schwartzian Transform is an excellent example of 
   thinking through Perl, in this case, using references and <span class="darkgreen">map()</span> together. Randal came up with 
   it extemporaneously. With enough practice, you'll be able to come up with time-saving 
   constructions of your own when you need them.</p>
  
  <p>We can't always sort things in our programs just by passing them to <span class="darkgreen">sort()</span>. Some things don't lend themselves to 
    being sorted, like dates: </p>
  
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: Dates</div><div class="observe"><pre>

  <p>The <span class="blue">date2str</span> routine converts the date into a form that will sort in the order that we 
   want. But let's think about how sorting happens; the <i>comparison function</i> (in this case,
   <span class="blue">bydate</span>) gets called by Perl's <span class="darkgreen">sort()</span> function every time it needs to 
    compare two elements to determine whether they're in the right order as it builds the result. <span class="darkgreen">sort()</span>
     is going to call that comparison function more than once for at least some of the dates (technically, an 
   optimum sort function requires <i>n log n</i> comparisons). But the comparison function has to call 
   the <i>conversion</i> function <span class="blue">date2str</span>, which means that <span class="blue">date2str</span> gets 
   called more than once with the same input, which is a waste, because it's going to produce the same 
   output each time. </p>
  
  <p>The Schwartzian Transform <i>caches</i> the results of calling the conversion routine for every item 
   in the input list, uses those cached values for the sort, then recovers the original list values. 
   With our example using dates, the conversion routine isn't particularly expensive; it doesn't eat up time and resources. 
   But if the input list was 
   something that required going to the system or the network, like looking up file modification times or 
   doing a DNS query, then this conversion routine would become more of a concern. </p>
  
   <p>Let's apply the Schwartzian Transform to our program. Modify <b>sort.pl</b> as shown: </p>
  
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE:</div><div class="listing"><pre>#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

chomp( my @dates = &lt;DATA&gt; );
print "Before:\n", map { "\t$_\n" } @dates;
<del>@dates = sort bydate @dates;</del>
<ins>@dates = map  { $_-&gt;[0] }
         sort { $a-&gt;[1] cmp $b-&gt;[1] }
         map  { [ $_, date2str($_) ] } @dates;
</ins>
print "After:\n", map { "\t$_\n" } @dates;

<del>sub bydate
{
  date2str($a) cmp date2str($b);
}
</del>
sub date2str  # 4/9/08 -&gt; 20080409
{
  my $date = shift;
  my ($month, $day, $year) = split m!/!, $date;
  $year += $year &gt; 50 ? 1900 : 2000;
  return sprintf "%d%02d%02d", $year, $month, $day
}

  <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it. You get exactly the same 
    result as before. How does this work? Take a look at the Schwartzian Transform in action: </p>
  
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE:</div><div class="observe"><pre>
<span class="red">@dates</span> = <span class="darkgreen">map</span>  { $_-&gt;[0] }
       <span class="green">sort</span> { <span class="red">$a</span>-&gt;[1] cmp <span class="red">$b</span>-&gt;[1] }
       <span class="darkgreen">map</span>  { [ <span class="purple">$_</span>, <span class="blue">date2str</span>(<span class="purple">$_</span>) ] } @dates;
</pre></div></div>
  
  <p>Remember the conveyor belt metaphor we saw earlier? It illustrated the way list items flow from right to left. 
    So, elements come from 
   <span class="red">@dates</span> and go into the first <span class="darkgreen">map()</span> statement, which turns them into an 
   arrayref pointing to two elements: the <span class="purple">original element</span>, and the result of calling 
   <span class="blue">date2str</span> on it. Then the conveyor belt moves things through the <span class="green">sort()</span> function; in 
   its comparison block each <span class="red">$a</span> and <span class="red">$b</span> is an arrayref, and we can compare them by 
   dereferencing the second element of each one (the result of calling <span class="blue">date2str</span>). Then, the 
   list of arrayrefs (sorted in the correct order) passes into the final <span class="darkgreen">map()</span> 
   statement, which extracts the first element from each arrayref, which is the original (date) element.
   Here's a picture of that process:</p>
  
  <p><div class="c"><img src="images/lessonImages/schwartzian.png"></div></p>
  
  <p>Most of the transform routine remains the same no matter what is being sorted, that's where our program is saving time.</p>
   
  <p>Study this example, play around, and have fun with it! We're getting into some really deep Perl here, and 
    you're getting better and better at data manipulation. Great work so far! </p>
