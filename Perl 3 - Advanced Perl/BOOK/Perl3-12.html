  <p>One of the most interesting types of reference that you can have is to a <i>subroutine</i>. That may 
   seem a bit mind-boggling to you at first. I mean, how can <i>code</i> be the same as <i>data</i>? 
    Well, coderefs are an unusual type of reference.  Let's dig in and see how coderefs work! </p>
  
  <a name="s_01"></a><div id="s_01"><div class="subheading">References to Named Subroutines</div><div class="subheadingText">
   
    <p>In order to create a reference to a subroutine, you type a backslash and then an 
      ampersand before the name of the subroutine. The syntax goes like this:</p>
   
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE:</div><div class="observe"><pre>
$code_ref = \&amp;subroutine_name
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p>We would apply that syntax like this:</p>
   
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE:</div><div class="observe"><pre>
sub square
{
  my $arg = shift;

  return $arg ** 2;
}

my $square_ref = \&amp;square; 
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p>Without that ampersand, Perl would think you were <i>calling</i> the routine <b>square</b>, and
    wanted to take a reference to the resultsâ€”you actually saw this happen in one of the homework questions in the previous 
    lesson. If you're wondering why an ampersand, it's possible to <i>call</i> a subroutine by putting
    an ampersand in front of its name, but that's not considered good practice.</p>
   
   <p>To dereference, we use the arrow operator. We use square brackets 
    after an arrow for an arrayref, curly braces after an arrow for a hashref, so what do you suppose 
    comes after an arrow for a coderef? We use parentheses, which contain any arguments to 
    pass to the subroutine:</p>
   
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE:</div><div class="observe"><pre>print $square_ref-&gt;( 42 );   # 1764
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p>Now try it out for yourself. Create <b>area.pl</b> in your <b>/perl3</b> folder as 
    shown:</p>
   
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE:</div><div class="listing"><pre>#!/usr/bin/perl

print "Area of triangle of side $side = ", $triangle_ref-&gt;( $side ), "\n";
print "Area of square of side   $side = ", $square_ref-&gt;( $side ), "\n";
print "Area of pentagon of side $side = ", $pentagon_ref-&gt;( $side ), "\n";

sub triangle  # Equilateral

  my $side = shift;

  return sqrt(3) / 4 * $side ** 2 
}

{
  my $side = shift;

  return $side ** 2;
}

   <p>The subroutine does <i>not</i> need to appear in the program before your references to 
    it, because Perl makes two passes through your program. It compiles subroutines on the first 
    pass, and resolves references on the second.</p>
   
   <p>Our next graphical representation of a code reference will be a bit different from those we've seen 
    before. The code that the reference points to is in your program, not in some dynamically-allocated 
    memory that gets created, deleted, expanded, or compressed while your program is running. Think 
    of it like this:</p>
   
   <p><div class="c"><img src="images/lessonImages/coderef.png"></div></p>
  
   <p>I intentionally drew the arrow to point at the contents of the subroutine <span class="blue">square</span>, and
    not at the word "square" itself.  Just as with the other references, when using coderefs, you cannot retrieve the name of 
    what is being referenced. But unlike other 
    references, you cannot make a new copy of what is being referenced. Any reference to that 
    code will point to the same code, not a new version. Since you can't change the code that is being 
    referenced, this distinction is mostly academic.</p>
   
   <p>Our polygon area program exhibits some regularity. Let's see what happens when we take advantage of that regularity
    by putting the coderefs into some data structures. Modify <b>area.pl</b> as shown:</p>

    <p>Sorry, I couldn't resist playing a little trick on you here. The number of sides that comprise the regular shapes for which we

  <a name="s_02"></a><div id="s_02"><div class="subheading">Dispatch Tables</div><div class="subheadingText">
  
   <p>Because we're now treating code like data, we can employ a highly useful programming 
    technique called a <i>dispatch table</i>. Let's see how to use the dispatch table in an example. 
     There were once text-based adventure games that involved dialogs like this one:</p>
   
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE:</div><div class="observe"><pre>Command: <ins>look</ins>
You are in a small cave with torches flickering on the blood-stained walls.
There are exits to the north, south, and east.
A hungry troll bars your way.
There is a sword here.
Command: <ins>give troll jewel</ins>
The troll scorns your feeble attempt at appeasement.
Command: <ins>take sword</ins>
Taken.
Command: <ins>kill troll with sword</ins>
(gory scenes omitted)
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p>We can implement a parser for the commands this game allows by using a separate subroutine for each major verb, 
    indexed through a hash that will become the dispatch table. It's not necessarily the best way, but we'll use it for now.

  <p>The two subroutines <span class="blue">open_log</span> and <span class="blue">write_log</span> are the only pieces of code 
   that can use the variable <span class="red">$fh</span>, because it is contained within the naked block.</p>
  
  <p>An even <i>more</i> useful kind of closure will have its code inside an anonymous subroutine. 
   One application of this is the technique known as <b>currying</b>, which allows you to 
    create a subroutine dynamically that acts like another subroutine, with some of its arguments fixed to certain 
   values. </p>
  
  <p>That's easier done than said though. Create <b>curry.pl</b> in the usual <b>/perl3</b> 
   folder:</p>
  
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE:</div><div class="listing"><pre><ins>#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

sub add
{
  my ($left, $right) = @_;

  return $left + $right;
}

sub make_adder
{
  my $operand = shift;

  return sub { add( $operand, @_ ) };
}


my $add_three = make_adder( 3 );
my $add_seven = make_adder( 7 );

my $i = 12;

print "\$i = $_\n" for $i, $add_three-&gt;($i), $add_seven-&gt;($i);
</ins></pre></div></div>
  
  <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it as shown:</p>
  
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~/perl3$ <ins>./curry.pl</ins>
$i = 12
$i = 15
$i = 19
</pre></div></div>
  
  <p>I admit, this isn't the most exciting example, but it does demonstrate the concept of currying well.
     Let's go over it in detail:</p> 
  
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE:</div><div class="observe"><pre>#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

sub add
{
  my ($left, $right) = <span class="orange">@_</span>;

  return $left + $right;
}

sub <span class="darkblue">make_adder</span>
{
  my <span class="darkred">$operand</span> = shift;

  return sub { add( <span class="darkred">$operand</span>, <span class="orange">@_</span> ) };
}


my $add_three = <span class="darkblue">make_adder</span>( 3 );
my $add_seven = <span class="darkblue">make_adder</span>( 7 );

my $i = 12;

print "\$i = $_\n" for $i, $add_three-&gt;($i), $add_seven-&gt;($i);
</pre></div></div>
  
  <p>The anonymous subroutine is closed over the variable <span class="darkred">$operand</span>. Each coderef that 
   is returned from <span class="darkblue">make_adder</span> is to the <i>same</i> piece of code, but each 
   coderef has a <i>different</i> idea of what <span class="darkred">$operand</span> contains: it's whatever
   it contained at the time the anonymous subroutine was constructed. The <span class="orange">@_</span> inside the
   anonymous code refers to the parameters that are passed to the coderef when it is called, <i>not</i>
    the parameters that are passed to the enclosing subroutine (in this case, <span class="blue">make_adder</span>).</p>
  
  <p>This is the basis for much more complex, and more useful code. We'll try out a more practical 
   example here, using a program from an earlier lesson.</p>
  
  <p>Open <b>stock.pl</b>, click the <b>Save As</b> 
   icon (<img src="images/coderunner/saveas.gif">) and save it as <b>stock2.pl</b> 
   in your <b>/perl3</b> folder. Now make these changes:</p>

<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE:</div><div class="listing"><pre>#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

<del>my $stock_ref = get_stock_ref( 'INSECTS' );
print "I have $$stock_ref{ants} ants\n";</del>

my @DATA = &lt;DATA&gt;;

<ins>my $insect_ref = get_stock_ref( 'INSECTS' );
my $fish_ref = get_stock_ref( 'FISH' );
print "I have ", $insect_ref-&gt;( 'ants' ), " ants\n";
print "I have ", $fish_ref-&gt;( 'guppies' ), " guppies\n";
print "When looking under insects:\n";
$insect_ref-&gt;( 'guppies' );</ins>

sub get_stock_ref
{
  my $seeking = shift;

  <del>my (@data, $type);
  while ( &lt;DATA&gt; )
  {
    if ( ( my ($what, $number) = /(.*)\s+(\d+)/ ) &amp;&amp; ( $type eq $seeking ) )
    {
      push @data, $what, $number;
    }
    elsif ( /(\S+)/ )
    {
      $type = $1;
    }
    else
    {
      next;
    }
  }
  return { @data };</del>
  
  <ins>return sub {
    my $want = shift;
    my $type;
    for ( @DATA )
    {
      if ( ( my ($what, $number) = /(.*)\s+(\d+)/ ) &amp;&amp; ( $type eq $seeking ) )
      {
        return $number if $what eq $want;
      }
      elsif ( /(\S+)/ )
      {
        $type = $1;
      }
      else

   <p>Here we've created routines that specialize in searching <i>insects</i> and <i>fish</i>, 
     respectively.</p>

  <a name="s_01"></a><div id="s_01"><div class="subheading">Callbacks</div><div class="subheadingText">
   
    <p>A <i>callback</i> is a subroutine reference passed to another subroutine to be executed as part of 
      some other code. Essentially, it lets you turn a program <i>inside-out</i>. We'll give it a try. Suppose you have written 
      some code that goes through all of the files in a directory. Create <b>files.pl</b> in 
      your <b>/perl3</b> folder as shown:</p>
         
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE:</div><div class="listing"><pre><ins>#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

process_directory( shift || '.' );

sub process_directory
{
  my $dir = shift;

  opendir my $dh, $dir or die "Couldn't open $dir: $!\n";
  while ( my $file = readdir $dh )
  {
    next if $file =~ /\A\.\.?\z/;
    print "Found an executable file: $file\n" if -x $file;
  }
}</ins>
</pre></div></div>
 
    <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it (the results may not match exactly):</p>
 
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~/perl3$ <ins>./files.pl</ins>

Found an executable file: graphic.pl
Found an executable file: stock.pl
Found an executable file: dispatch.pl
Found an executable file: area.pl
Found an executable file: curry.pl
</pre></div></div>
 
    <p>But this isn't very generalizable code. Our routine for processing a directory is specialized to 
      look for executable files. But we want to pass in <i>behavior</i> as a parameter. A 
      callback lets us do that. Modify the program as shown:</p>
    
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE:</div><div class="listing"><pre>#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

process_directory( shift || '.' <ins>, \&amp;is_executable </ins> );

<ins>sub is_executable
{
  my $file = shift;

  print "Found an executable file: $file\n" if -x $file;
}</ins>
  
sub process_directory
{
  my $dir = shift;
  <ins>my $callback = shift;</ins>

  opendir my $dh, $dir or die "Couldn't open $dir: $!\n";
  while ( my $file = readdir $dh )
  {
    next if $file =~ /\A\.\.?\z/;
    <ins>$callback-&gt;( $file );</ins>
    <del>print "Found an executable file: $file\n";</del>
  }
}
</pre></div></div>

    <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it. The results will be the same as 
      before. But now we can make our directory processing code do all kinds of things without having to 
      rewrite that <span class="darkgreen">readdir()</span> loop every time. Modify your code as shown:</p>
 
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE:</div><div class="listing"><pre>#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

process_directory( shift || '.', <del>\&amp;is_executable</del> <ins>\&amp;print_size</ins> );

<ins>sub print_size
{
  my $file = shift;

  print "$file is ", -s $file, " bytes long\n";
}
</ins>
sub is_executable
{
  my $file = shift;

  print "Found an executable file: $file\n" if -x $file;
}

sub process_directory
{
  my $dir = shift;
  my $callback = shift;

  opendir my $dh, $dir or die "Couldn't open $dir: $!\n";
  while ( my $file = readdir $dh )
  {
    next if $file =~ /\A\.\.?\z/;
    $callback-&gt;( $file );
  }
}

   <p>Before we close out this lesson you want to be aware of a few more coderef behaviors.</p>
   
  <a name="s_01"></a><div id="s_01"><div class="subheading">ref()</div><div class="subheadingText">

    <p>Expressions dereferencing subroutines <i>cannot</i> be interpolated in double-quoted strings. 
      But you <i>can</i> leave out the arrow between braces and parentheses, for example:</p>
   
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE:</div><div class="observe"><pre>$area_ref{$sides}( $side ); 
</pre></div></div>
   
    <p>This is not common practice though. Perl programmers are used to arrows when code is being called 
      by reference, and some of that expectation is due to the syntax for<i> method calls</i>. Method calls are 
     investigated further in a later course.</p>
   
    <p>If you're curious and wondering how you would apply Rule 1 and Rule 2 to dereferencing 
      subroutine references (and I know that you are!), the answer lies in the ampersand syntax. Check it out:</p>
   
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE:</div><div class="observe"><pre>&amp;{ <i>expression_returning_coderef</i> }( arguments )
</pre></div></div>
   
    <p>But really, that's so ugly, it's just not worth the trouble.</p>
    <p>Nice work so far. You've got a handle on referencesâ€”no easy feat! Next up: exceptions and how 
    to deal with them. See you in the next lesson!</p>
