 <p>Welcome to a new lesson, where you'll use the Perl skills you've learned so far, and incorporate some new ones to 
  manipulate lists at a whole new level! In this 
  lesson we'll add two important functions to your tool chest: <span class="darkgreen">grep()</span> and <span class="darkgreen">map()</span>.  
 Both of these functions take a list as input, and provide a list as output. These tools 
 will allow you to transform lists using simple expressions rather than whole blocks of code. Sounds great, right? Let's get 
  going!</p>
 <ul><li><a href="Perl3-05.html#grep">grep()</a></li><li><a href="Perl3-05.html#map">map()</a></li></ul>

  <p>If you've used the Unix program called <b>grep</b>—and we built a simplified version of it in 
   Perl&nbsp;2—you may be tempted to think that the <span class="darkgreen">grep()</span> function in Perl does the same thing. 
   Well, it's 
   kind of related, except that Perl's <span class="darkgreen">grep()</span> 
   really has nothing to do with regular expressions.</p>
   
  <p>The <span class="darkgreen">grep()</span> function is used to select the elements of a list that match some 
   criteria. And it lets you write less code than you would building a loop and a temporary array to serve that same purpose. 
   Let's try executing that task without using <span class="darkgreen">grep()</span> first. Create <b>tracks.pl</b> in your 
   <b>/perl3</b> folder as shown:</p>

<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE:</div><div class="listing"><pre>#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

my $MINUTE = 60;   # Seconds therein

my %length;

while ( &lt;DATA&gt; )
{
  next unless /\A\d+\.\s+"(.*?)".*\s(\d+):(\d+)/;
  my ($title, $min, $sec) = ($1, $2, $3);
  $length{$title} = $min * $MINUTE + $sec;
}

my $limit = shift || 3;
my @long_tracks;
for my $title ( sort keys %length)
{
  push @long_tracks, $title if $length{$title} &gt; $limit * $MINUTE;
}
report( $limit, @long_tracks );

sub report
{
  my $limit = shift;

  print "Tracks over $limit minutes long:\n";
  print "$_\n" for @_;
}

  <p>Our program <b>tracks.pl</b> takes an optional argument to report the minimum length of a track in minutes. 
   <img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it:</p>
  
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>code:~$ <ins>cd perl3</ins>

  <p>The goal in this program was to construct the array <b>@long_tracks</b> and have it contain the titles we 
   wanted. We could have reported them one at a time in the loop, but imagine that we need 
   that array for something else later in the program. Now let's change the program and try something else. Modify your code as shown:</p>

  <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it. You'll see exactly the same output as 
   before.</p>
   
  <p>So how does it work?  The <span class="darkgreen">grep()</span> function's general form looks like this:</p>
   
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE:</div><div class="observe"><pre>
<span class="purple">RESULT_LIST</span> = <span class="darkgreen">grep</span> { <span class="darkblue">EXPRESSION</span> } <span class="darkred">LIST</span>
</pre></div></div>

     <p>Or, in our example:</p>
  
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE:</div><div class="observe"><pre>
<span class="purple">my @long_tracks</span> = <span class="darkgreen">grep</span> { <span class="darkblue">$length{$_} &gt; $limit * $MINUTE</span> } <span class="darkred">sort keys %length</span>
</pre></div></div>
   
  <p>Your chosen <span class="darkblue">EXPRESSION</span> goes inside the curly braces; Perl evaluates it 
   in Boolean context once for each element of the input list <span class="darkred">LIST</span>. <span class="red">$_</span> 
   is set equal to each element in turn (this is much like the postfixed foreach statement). If the result of 
   <span class="darkblue">EXPRESSION</span> is true, the element being evaluated is added to  
   <span class="purple">RESULT_LIST</span>; if not, it is ignored. </p>
  
  <p>So <span class="darkgreen">grep()</span> works as a filter; any elements of the input that pass the test in 
   <span class="darkblue">EXPRESSION</span> go through to the result.</p>
    
  <p>The braces delimit a block of code; you can have multiple statements within them (separated by 
   semicolons). The value of the last statement or expression in the block of code will be used for the test. 
   So this description of <span class="darkgreen">grep()</span> is equally valid:</p>
      
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE:</div><div class="observe"><pre>
<span class="purple">RESULT_LIST</span> = <span class="darkgreen">grep</span> { <span class="darkblue">CODE</span> } <span class="darkred">LIST</span>
</pre></div></div>
   
  <p>You could, for example, replace the code <b>{ $length{$_} &gt; $limit * $MINUTE }</b> in the program 
   above with <b>{ my $len = $length{$_}; $len / $MINUTE &gt; $limit }</b> and 
   it would perform exactly the same function.</p>
   
  <p>I like to think of a conveyor belt metaphor for <span class="darkgreen">grep()</span>: </p>
 
  <p><div class="c"><img src="images/lessonImages/conveyor_grep_small.png"></div></p>
   
  <p>As each element of the input list passes (from right to left) through the expression/code block, it either 
   makes it out the other end into the result, or is rejected.</p>
   
  <p>Here's an example of a common use of <span class="darkgreen">grep()</span>. The <span class="darkgreen">readdir()</span> 
   function for returning a list of filenames in a directory corresponding to a directory handle opened by 
   <span class="darkgreen">opendir()</span> always returns the two directories "." and ".." as part of the list, because 
   those entries are always in every directory. Since they correspond to the current directory and parent 
   directory respectively, it is almost never useful to process those elements. Let's take a look. Create 
   <b>directory.pl</b> in your <b>/perl3</b> folder as shown: </p>

<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE:</div><div class="listing"><pre>#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

opendir my $dh, '.' or die "Can't open . $!\n";
my @files = readdir $dh;
print "$_\n" for sort @files;
</pre></div></div>
   
  <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it. Near the top, the lines "." and 
   ".." are printed. Those elements 
   are almost certainly going to get in the way, regardless of the purpose we put <b>@files</b> to in our program. </p>
   
  <p>Here's how we usually solve this problem. Modify <b>directory.pl</b> as follows:</p>
  
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE:</div><div class="listing"><pre>#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

opendir my $dh, '.' or die "Can't open . $!\n";
my @files = <ins>grep { ! /\A\.\.?\z/ } </ins>readdir $dh;
print "$_\n" for sort @files;
</pre></div></div>
   
  <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it. The "." and ".." lines are no longer 
   printed. Because <b>$_</b> is set in the block to the current element being considered, we can include 
   a match expression that is implicitly bound to <b>$_</b>, as we have done here. Do you understand the 
   regex? It means:</p>
   
 <div class="c"> <table class="tbl" border=""><tr><td>!</td><td>Negation</td></tr><tr><td>\A</td><td>Must start with</td></tr><tr><td>\.</td><td>Literal period</td></tr><tr><td>\.?</td><td>Followed by zero or one literal periods</td></tr><tr><td>\z</td><td>Must end here</td></tr></table></div>
   
  <p>We'll be using regexes of increasing complexity in our programs from now on. If you don't understand 
   them, review the corresponding material from earlier lessons, in the <b>Intermediate Perl</b> course, or 
   ask your instructor. </p>
 
 </div>
 <a href="Perl3-05.html" name="map"></a>
 <a name="h_02"></a><div class="heading">map()</div><div class="headingText">
   
  <p><span class="darkgreen">map()</span> is like <span class="darkgreen">grep()</span>, only it's even cooler! It has the same general 
   form:</p>
         
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE:</div><div class="observe"><pre>
<span class="purple">RESULT_LIST</span> = <span class="darkgreen">map</span> { <span class="darkblue">EXPRESSION or CODE</span> } <span class="darkred">LIST</span>
</pre></div></div>
   
  <p>And just like with 
   <span class="darkgreen">grep()</span>, with <span class="darkgreen">map()</span>the block is 
    executed once for each element of the input <span class="darkred">LIST</span>, 
   with <span class="red">$_</span> being set to each element in turn. But in this case, the result of the block is not used 
   to decide whether to pass the element through, but is used <i>as</i> the output element!</p>
   
  <p>Let's try some examples. Create <b>miles.pl</b> in your <b>/perl3</b> folder as shown:</p>

<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE:</div><div class="listing"><pre>#!/usr/bin/perl -C2

  <p>If you didn't get the accents on the last three lines, make sure you have the <b>-C2</b> flag on the 
   shebang line (that's the first line of a Perl program, by the way—it begins with #!). 
   This is not usually necessary and is mostly required here due to the complex environment that 
   brings the terminal window to you through a Java applet.</p>
   
  <p>If you're curious about how the cosine wave pattern of asterisks was made, check out 
   <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/perlop.html" target="_blank">perldoc perlop</a>
   for the explanation of the <span class="darkgreen">x</span> (repetition) operator in scalar context.</p>
   
  <p>In our code there are several examples of the use of the <span class="darkgreen">map()</span> operator.
   Go over each one carefully to make sure you understand them; the code in each case is brief and 
   could easily be overlooked.</p>
  <p> The <span class="darkgreen">values()</span> 
   function returns a list of <i>aliases</i> to the actual values, meaning that if I change those values, I 
   change the actual values in the hash itself. Go to <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/functions/values.html" target="_blank">perldoc -f values</a> to read about that feature.</p>
   
  <p>In the conveyor belt metaphor, the machine that the inputs pass through gets to replace each input with 
   whatever it wants, usually the result of transforming the input in some way:</p>
   
  <p><div class="c"><img src="images/lessonImages/conveyor_map_small.png"></div></p>
   
  <p>This is important: the expression (or last statement) in the block is evaluated in <i>list</i>
   context, so it can return <i>any number</i> of elements. That means that the number of elements in the 
   output doesn't have to be the same as the number of elements in the input: it can be fewer (if the block 
   evaluates to an empty list at least some of the time) or more (if the block evaluates to a list containing 
   two or more elements at least some of the time). </p>
      
  <p>For example, we may create a hash merely to test for <i>set existence</i>, because we want to know whether some string is a key in the 
   hash. We usually make all the values in the hash <b>1</b> in this case. If the hash is created 
   from a literal list of keys or an array of keys, the code is longer than it has to be. Create 
   <b>map_hash.pl</b> in your <b>/perl3</b> folder as shown:</p>
  
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE:</div><div class="listing"><pre>#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

my %marsupial = (koala =&gt; 1, kangaroo =&gt; 1, possum =&gt; 1, wombat =&gt; 1);

chomp( my @amphibians = &lt;DATA&gt; );

my %amphibian;
$amphibian{$_} = 1 for @amphibians;

print "Marsupials: ", join( ' ', sort keys %marsupial ), "\n";
print "Amphibians: ", join( ' ', sort keys %amphibian ), "\n";

  <p>I'm always sneaking something extra into these examples! See how this program 
   <span class="darkgreen">chomp()</span>s every member of an array in one pass? Take a look at 
   <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/functions/chomp.html" target="_blank">perldoc -f chomp</a> for further explanation. </p>
   
  <p>That program shows two ways of setting a hash: a literal list and 
   setting from an array of keys. In each case, every value in the hash is <b>1</b>. Now modify <b>map_hash.pl</b> as 
   shown:</p>
  
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE:</div><div class="listing"><pre>#!/usr/bin/perl

  <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it. You get exactly the same output 
   as before. The result of each <span class="darkgreen">map()</span> block is a two-element list (I put parentheses 
   around them to make this clearer, but you can actually leave them off): the element from the input list (the
   desired key) and the literal <b>1</b> (the value).</p>
   
  <p>There is always another way to get the same results you would from <span class="darkgreen">grep()</span> and 
   <span class="darkgreen">map()</span>; but using them may keep your code shorter and more readable. Remember, Perl's 
   motto is, <i>"There's More Than One Way To Do It"</i>—in fact, that's the subtitle of the book 
   <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596000271.do">"Programming Perl"</a>
    published by O'Reilly! </p>
   
  <p><div class="c"><img src="images/lessonImages/camel_cover.png"></div></p>
   
  <p>A word of warning: sometimes programmers get carried away with the succinctness of <span class="darkgreen">map()</span>
   and use it where they should be using <b>foreach</b> statements. You can tell that this 
   is happening is when they are ignoring the output list. For instance: </p>
   
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE:</div><div class="observe"><pre>
my $total = 0;
map { $total += $length{$_} } grep { $length{$_} &gt; $limit * $MINUTE } keys %length;
</pre></div></div>
   
  <p>We call that using <span class="darkgreen">map()</span> in a <i>void context</i>. It may <i>work,</i> but it's not a good practice; it 
   makes the code harder to understand by another Perl programmer, who will wonder why there is no output list. 
   And it's not any shorter than the preferred code either: </p>
   
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE:</div><div class="observe"><pre>my $total = 0;
$total += $length{$_} for grep { $length{$_} &gt; $limit * $MINUTE } keys %length;
</pre></div></div>
   
  <p>It's not uncommon to see <span class="darkgreen">grep()</span> and <span class="darkgreen">map()</span> blocks that 
   are several lines long. Just make sure to indent them thoughtfully to help the reader if you're writing code like that. Later on 
   in this course we'll join a <span class="darkgreen">map()</span>, a 
   <span class="darkgreen">grep()</span>, and another <span class="darkgreen">map()</span> together in a chain!  There's no reason that one 
   conveyor belt can't feed into another, after all. </p>
  
  <p>We are making really good progress. Keep it going in the next lesson! See you there...</p>
  
 </div>
 
 <p>Once you finish the lesson, go back to the syllabus to complete the homework.</p>
