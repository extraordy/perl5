  <p>Welcome to lesson seven, an exploration of <b>references</b> in Perl.</p>

      
 <a href="Perl3-07.html" name="references_to_scalars"></a>
 <a name="h_01"></a><div class="heading">References to Scalars</div><div class="headingText">
 
  <p>I've claimed, "this is a really important and useful feature of Perl!" so often, I must sound 
   like a cross between an infomercial presenter and a politician. But trust me, all the great stuff I've told you about Perl is true! 
   But wait—there's more! Here's yet another great Perl feature: <b>references</b>. </p>
   
   <p>References are scalars that point, or <i>refer to</i>,  
    data somewhere else. When you want use the values they point to, you dereference the references. </p>
         
   <p>So far you've seen that scalars can contain strings, numbers, or filehandles (or 
   directory handles, which are a lot like filehandles). But a reference is an entirely new element 
   for a scalar to contain.</p>
   
  <p>References unlock the door to all the kinds of data representation and 
   processing that you can do in Perl. The most advanced Perl programs depend on references. We'll spend most 
   of the rest of this course learning about references in all their glory, which will enable you to 
   write programs for complex data manipulation. And, if you go on to our fourth Perl course, 
   we'll use that knowledge of references to do object-oriented programming for
   everything from e-mail to databases. Perl references are a really big deal!</p>
    
  <p>We'll start with the basics; making and using references to scalars. But first, let me tell you 
   what a Perl reference is <i>not:</i> it is <i>not</i> the same as a C/C++ pointer. (Don't worry if you're not familiar with 
   C or C++.) Even though I will be using diagrams containing arrows, and I may use the phrase "points to" when 
   talking about references, a reference in Perl 
   can be used for only one thing: getting back the thing to which it points. You <i>cannot</i> perform "pointer 
    arithmetic" on Perl references (if you're not familiar with pointer arithmetic, that's okay too).</p>
     
  <p>In order to make a reference to a named <span class="darkblue">scalar</span> in our code, we type a <span class="green">backslash</span> 
   before the scalar; the result of that expression is the <span class="darkred">reference</span> to that scalar:</p>
     
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE:</div><div class="observe"><pre>
<span class="darkred">$scalar_ref</span> = <span class="green">\</span><span class="darkblue">$scalar</span>;
</pre></div></div>
        
  <p>At first it may seem odd to use the backslash as a operator for forming a reference; so far we've only seen the backslash 
  as an escape character or part of a digraph, but that was from inside of strings or regexes. Now our 
   backslash occurs within program code. Let's try an example. Create <b>scalar_ref.pl</b> in your 
   <b>/perl3</b> folder as shown:</p>
     
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE:</div><div class="listing"><pre>#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

my $marsupial = 'wallaby';

my $creature_ref = \$marsupial;

print $$creature_ref, "\n";
</pre></div></div>
     
  <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it as shown:</p>
  
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>
code:~$ <ins>cd perl3</ins>
cold:~/perl3$ <ins>./scalar_ref.pl</ins>
wallaby
</pre></div></div>
     
  <p>Okay, so that may not have been super exciting, but hey—we gotta start somewhere, right? In addition 
   to <i>taking</i> a reference, we've shown you what to do with it: you can get back the scalar it refers to by 
   putting a dollar sign (<span class="green">$</span>) in front of the <span class="darkblue">reference</span>, like this: </p>
     
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE:</div><div class="observe"><pre>
$scalar = <span class="green">$</span><span class="darkblue">$scalar_ref</span>
</pre></div></div>
     
  <p>At first, that construction may seem odd too because it brings to mind the special variable 
   <b>$$</b> (which is the current process ID). Or it may just seem odd because, like the backslash, we haven't
   thought of a dollar sign as an operator before. And yet here both of those symbols are being pressed into service as operators. The 
   different syntactical contexts in which they are used allow those symbols to be used for varied purposes. </p>
     
  <p>Here's a visual aid for the reference to help makes this a bit more clear:</p>
     
  <p><div class="c"><img src="images/lessonImages/scalar_ref.png"></div></p>
     
  <p>In this diagram the reference arrow points to the data that is stored in the variable with 
    the name <b>$marsupial;</b> not at the name <b>$marsupial</b> itself. This distinction will become increasingly important as we 
   go on through the lessons.</p>
     
  <p>Now, if you're curious—and I hope you are—you probably already wondered what's inside of that orange blob in the  
   <b>$scalar_ref</b> and what you can do with it. So let's do some experimentation 
   with it to see what happens. (I encourage you to try this kind of thing yourself all the time—be fearless! You can't 
   break our system. The worst that could happen is that you encounter something strange and you have to 
   ask your instructor for help. No problem.) Modify the program as shown:</p>
     
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE:</div><div class="listing"><pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

my $marsupial = 'wallaby';

my $creature_ref = \$marsupial;

print $$creature_ref, "\n";
<ins>print "\$creature_ref = $creature_ref\n";</ins>
</pre></div></div>
     
  <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it as shown:</p>

<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~/perl3$ <ins>./scalar_ref.pl</ins>
wallaby
$creature_ref = SCALAR(0x94a26fc)
</pre></div></div>
     
  <p>That's really interesting! I bet you didn't see that coming. It's Perl's way of saying, "This is a reference 
   to a scalar." (The hexadecimal number may be different on your screen, that's okay.)</p>
     
  <p>We just printed out a scalar as a <i>string</i> (by interpolating it inside double quotation marks).
   I wonder if it would look different if we printed it as a <i>number</i>? Some special 
   variables in Perl can behave differently when treated as numbers instead of strings. We can force Perl to 
   interpret a scalar as a number by performing an arithmetic operation on the scalar that expects it to be a number, 
   but won't change the value of that number. Adding or subtracting zero, or multiplying or dividing by one 
   will do that. Modify <b>scalar_ref.pl</b> as shown: </p>
     
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE:</div><div class="listing"><pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

my $marsupial = 'wallaby';

my $creature_ref = \$marsupial;

print $$creature_ref, "\n";
print "\$creature_ref = $creature_ref\n";
<ins>print "\$creature_ref = ", $creature_ref + 0, "\n";</ins>
</pre></div></div>
     
  <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it as shown:</p>

<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~/perl3$ <ins>./scalar_ref.pl</ins>
wallaby
$creature_ref = SCALAR(0x928d6fc)
$creature_ref = 155854588
</pre></div></div>
     
  <p>Look at that: the reference is also a number. And you're probably thinking, "Is it the same number 
   as the hexadecimal string in parentheses?" You can perform this test to find your answer.
   Modify <b>scalar_ref.pl</b> as shown:</p>
    
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE:</div><div class="listing"><pre>#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

my $marsupial = 'wallaby';

my $creature_ref = \$marsupial;

print $$creature_ref, "\n";
print "\$creature_ref = $creature_ref\n";
<del>print "\$creature_ref = ", $creature_ref + 0, "\n";</del>
<ins>printf "\$creature_ref = %x\n", $creature_ref;</ins>
</pre></div></div>
     
  <p>(We no longer need to add zero because the <b>%x</b> format specified in 
   <span class="darkgreen">printf()</span> will impose a numeric context.)</p> 

   <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it as shown:</p>

<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>
cold:~/perl3$ <ins>./scalar_ref.pl</ins>
wallaby
$creature_ref = SCALAR(0x928d6fc)
$creature_ref = 928d6fc
</pre></div></div>
     
  <p>That's not so surprising. If Perl has a cryptic hexadecimal number in a reference's string value and 
   a cryptic number associated with the same reference's numeric value, it makes sense that they would be the same 
   number.</p>
     
   <p>I mentioned earlier that pointer arithmetic was pointless with references. Let's add to it and see what happens. Modify <b>scalar_ref.pl</b> 
     as shown:</p>
     
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE:</div><div class="listing"><pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

my $marsupial = 'wallaby';

my $creature_ref = \$marsupial;

print $$creature_ref, "\n";
print "\$creature_ref = $creature_ref\n";
printf "\$creature_ref = %x\n", $creature_ref;
<ins>my $augmented = $creature_ref + 32;
printf "\$creature_ref + 32 = %x\n", $augmented;

print "\$augmented = $augmented\n";
print "\$$augmented = ", $$augmented, "\n";</ins>
</pre></div></div>
     
  <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it as shown:</p>

<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>
cold:~/perl3$ <ins>./scalar_ref.pl</ins>
wallaby
$creature_ref = SCALAR(0x9bb96fc)
$creature_ref = 9bb96fc
$creature_ref + 32 = 9bb971c
$augmented = 163288860
Can't use string ("163288860") as a SCALAR ref while "strict refs" in use at ./scalar_ref.pl line 19.
</pre></div></div>
     
  <p>So what happened?  As soon as we added something to the reference, the result was a plain old number; there 
   was no magic <b>SCALAR(0x...)</b> printed when we put it in a double-quoted string. Attempting to 
   dereference that result produced an error. </p>
     
  <p>The reference has only one really useful ability and that is to get back the thing 
   it references, by <i>dereferencing</i> it. When our program changed, even the number that was associated with the reference changed. And you
    may have noticed 
   that I have never referred to that number as an "address." It may look like an address, but you 
   can't actually do anything with addresses in Perl. The only guarantee is that references to the same thing will 
   stringify or numerify to the same values, and references to different things will not. Modify 
   <b>scalar_ref.pl</b> as shown here: </p>
     
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE:</div><div class="listing"><pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

my $marsupial = 'wallaby';

my $creature_ref = \$marsupial;

print $$creature_ref, "\n";
print "\$creature_ref = $creature_ref\n";
<del>printf "\$creature_ref = %x\n", $creature_ref;

my $augmented = $creature_ref + 32;
printf "\$creature_ref + 32 = %x\n", $augmented;

print "\$augmented = $augmented\n";
print "\$$augmented = ", $$augmented, "\n";</del>

<ins>my $ref_copy = $creature_ref;
print "\$ref_copy     = $ref_copy\n";

my $australian = 'wallaby';
my $aussie_ref = \$australian;

print "\$aussie_ref   = $aussie_ref\n";</ins>
</pre></div></div>
     
  <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it as shown:</p>

<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>
cold:~/perl3$ <ins>./scalar_ref.pl</ins>

$creature_ref = SCALAR(0x93276fc)
$ref_copy     = SCALAR(0x93276fc)
$aussie_ref   = SCALAR(0x933b78c)
</pre></div></div>

  <p>The numbers may be different for you, but the important thing to note is that the references 
   <b>$creature_ref</b> and <b>$ref_copy</b> stringify identically (you can use 
   <b>eq</b> to test whether they refer to the same thing); and <b>$creature_ref</b> and 
   <b>$aussie_ref</b> stringify to different strings, because they point to different scalars, even though 
   the scalars they point to <i>happen</i> to have the same value. </p>
     
  <p>Okay, so that's enough about the mechanics of references for now; let's get busy working. We're going to focus more 
   or less exclusively now on taking references and dereferencing. References to scalars are good, but 
   references to arrays even better! Let's learn about those.</p>
 </div>
 <a href="Perl3-07.html" name="references_to_arrays"></a>
 <a name="h_02"></a><div class="heading">References to Arrays</div><div class="headingText">
   
  <p>For our next example, we'll use a reference to an array with the backslash operator, just like we did before:</p>
   
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE:</div><div class="observe"><pre>

  <p>Perl is very consistent in its reference syntax: to dereference a reference to an array, put an at sign 
   (<b>@</b>) in front of it; this will return the contents of the array. Here's a graphic representation to help you visualize
   and understand array references: </p>

  <p>Even from deep inside that subroutine, your reference was able to modify <b>$marsupial</b> 
    and <b>@snakes</b> through the references to them, even though the variables they referred to were no 
   longer in scope during that subroutine. Remember, references point to <i>storage:</i> the data 
   <i>stored</i> in the variable for which you've taken a reference.</p>
   
   <p>Everywhere you can use a scalar variable like <b>$marsupial</b>, you can use a dereferenced
     reference to a scalar: <b>$$creature_ref</b>. In the subroutine above we copied the reference 
     <b>$creature_ref</b> into <b>$scalar_ref</b> (it still points to the same thing—we 
     established that behavior earlier) and we were able to use the dereferenced reference as an <b>lvalue</b> 
     (an <b>lvalue</b> is an expression that you can write on the left hand side of an assignment statement; it 
   defines a specific memory address of a variable) to
   modify the original data. The same goes for the array reference.</p>
   
  <p>You can use an array reference anywhere you'd have the <i>name</i> portion of an array (the identifier that
    comes after the <b>@</b> sigil—a sigil is the bit of punctuation that tells Perl what sort of variable is being used) in code; 
    this program gives some examples of those constructions so you 
      can see what I mean. Create <b>array_ref_ex.pl</b> in your <b>/perl3</b> folder as shown:</p>

  <p>Do you see what I mean?  If you want to know how to do a particular operation with an array reference, 
   just ask yourself how you'd do it with an array named, for instance, <b>@foo</b>, and replace the <b>foo</b>
   part of the construction with the reference.</p>   
         
  <p>Take another look at the graphical representation of the array reference. I made sure to draw a
   distinction between an array and the scalars that are contained within it. What do you suppose <i>this</i>
   diagram represents?:</p>
   
  <p><div class="c"><img src="images/lessonImages/element_ref.png"></div></p>

  <p>You may have noticed that I tend to repeat myself. It isn't because I don't have confidence in your ability 
    to catch information the first time around. I repeat important information to help you retain it—and there's a lot of it. 
    So let me reiterate here, 
    references point to the data that is stored in a scalar or array, not to the
   name of that scalar or array. In fact, given a reference, you cannot retrieve the name of the thing that it 
   points to, only the data stored in it. And frequently we write subroutines that expect one or more 
   references in their arguments, so we end up passing references around our code like ordinary data. So, what

  <p>This code could be a good start to internationalizing a program. But look how long our 
   routine <b>make_day_ref</b> is. Essentially it's just defining data. So, what's the point in 
   defining the names <b>@english_names</b>, <b>@french_names</b>, and so on, when we only use them once, in 
   order to take a reference?</p>
   
  <p>The answer lies in a new piece of Perl syntax, the <b>anonymous array reference constructor</b>. That's quite 
    a mouthful! The <b>anonymous array reference constructor</b> is an expression that returns a reference to 
    an array that we never bothered putting into 
   a named variable before, so we put <b>square brackets</b> around the 
   <i><b>list</b></i> we want in that array instead, like this:</p>
   
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE:</div><div class="observe"><pre>
$array_ref = <span class="blue">[</span> <i><span class="darkred">list</span></i> <span class="blue">]</span>
</pre></div></div>
   
  <p>Let's see that at work; modify <b>anon_ref.pl</b> as shown:</p>
  
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE:</div><div class="listing"><pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

my $day_ref = make_day_ref( 'German' );

print "Der dritte tag der woche ist $$day_ref[2]\n";


sub make_day_ref
{
  my $language = shift;
<del>
  my @english_names = qw(Sunday Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday);
  my @french_names  = qw(Dimanche Lundi Mardi Mercredi Jeudi Vendredi Samedi);
  my @german_names  = qw(Sonntag Montag Dienstag Mittwoch Donnerstag Freitag Samstag);</del>
  if ( $language eq 'English' )
  {
    return <del>\@english_names</del> <ins>[ qw(Sunday Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday) ]</ins>;
  }
  elsif ( $language eq 'French' )
  {
    return <del>\@french_names</del> <ins>[ qw(Dimanche Lundi Mardi Mercredi Jeudi Vendredi Samedi) ]</ins>;
  }
  elsif ( $language eq 'German' )
  {
    return <del>\@german_names</del> <ins>[ qw(Sonntag Montag Dienstag Mittwoch Donnerstag Freitag Samstag) ]</ins>;
  }
  else
  {
    die "Unrecognized language $language";
  }
}</pre></div></div>
  <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it. The result should be the same as before. But we've 
   made the code shorter! Now we don't need to think up variable names just to be able to construct 
   references.</p>
   
  <p>The anonymous array ref constructor may look odd; we're used to seeing square brackets used to 
   delimit array indexes. Don't worry, Perl can tell when you're using them for this purpose.</p>
   
  <p>Now you may be wondering whether there is an anonymous scalar ref constructor. There is, but 
   we don't often have a need for them, so I'll just show it to you briefly:</p>
   
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE:</div><div class="observe"><pre>
$scalar_ref = <span class="blue">\</span><i>LITERAL</i>
</pre></div></div>
   
  <p>That's right, you just put a <span class="blue">backslash</span> in front of any literal value to which you want a 
   reference. For instance:</p>
   
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE:</div><div class="observe"><pre>
$e_ref = <span class="blue">\</span>2.71828183;
$name_ref = <span class="blue">\</span>"Peter";
</pre></div></div>
   
  <p>These anonymous scalar references are <i>immutable</i> (or 
   "constant," if you like); you can't change them. That quality can be useful in certain circumstances. Try this one-liner:</p>
   
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>
cold:~/perl3$ <ins>perl -le '$s_ref = \"four"; print $$s_ref; $$s_ref = 42'</ins>
four
Modification of a read-only value attempted at -e line 1.
</pre></div></div>
   
  <p>That is <i>not</i> true of anonymously-constructed array references:</p>
   
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>
cold:~/perl3$ <ins>perl -le '$a_ref = [ 10..20 ]; print "@$a_ref"; $$a_ref[5] *= 2; print "@$a_ref"'</ins>
10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20
10 11 12 13 14 30 16 17 18 19 20
</pre></div></div>
   
  <p>Finally, here's what happens when you stringify (in this case, by printing) an array ref:</p>
   
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE:</div><div class="observe"><pre>
cold:~/perl3$ <ins>perl -le '$a_ref = [ 10..20 ]; print $a_ref'</ins>
ARRAY(0x8cf2158)
</pre></div></div>
   
  <p>There's no real use to printing out a reference, but 
    sooner or later you'll make the mistake of using a reference  
   where you meant to use a scalar, and you'll see a string like that instead. But this way you'll know 
   what it means. </p>
  
 </div>
 
 <p>We've only just begun to cover references and you can see already that they are the keys to 
  "packaging" data to pass around your program. It gets even better from here!</p>
   
 <p>Once you finish the lesson, go back to the syllabus to complete the homework.</p>
