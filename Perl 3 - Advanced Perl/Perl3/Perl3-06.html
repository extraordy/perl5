 <p>Welcome back! In this lesson, we'll cover a few more modifiers that you can place

  <p>I'd like to introduce two new anchors to you: <b>^</b> and <b>$</b>. The <b>/m</b> modifier allows you 
   to use those anchors to represent the beginning and end of a line, respectively. Let's try 
   a quick example. Go to your editor and in your <b>/perl3</b> folder, 
   create 
   <b>multimatch.pl</b> as shown:</p>

  <p>So that's how <b>^</b> and <b>$</b> behave <i>without</i> the <b>/m</b> modifier (I showed you right 
   away because I <i>knew</i> that would be one of your first questions!): they match at the beginning and end 
   of the <i>string</i>, not each line. To help remember what <b>/m</b> does, think of it as standing for "multiline" mode.</p>
   
  <p>I can guess what you're thinking: "Now hold on a minute, Perl already has anchors for the beginning and end of the
   string: <b>\A</b> and <b>\z</b>, respectively. I know that Perl's motto is, 'There's more than one way to do 
   it,' but isn't this going too far?"</p>
   
  <p>Well, you're partly right. There's a lot of subtle information we're about to cover here, just go with it. 
   If you 
   read much Perl code written by others, you'll run into frequent use of the <b>^</b> and <b>$</b> 
   anchors to indicate the beginning and end of strings. When Larry Wall designed Perl, he wanted to create a 
   regex language that felt familiar
   to programmers. The <b>\A</b> and <b>\z</b> anchors didn't exist yet, so he used the <b>^</b> and <b>$</b> anchors, 
   which were already established in existing regular expression tools.</p>
   
  <p>But <b>^</b> and <b>$</b> are not the best choices for this syntax. The <b>^</b> symbol already has an 
   inordinate number of meanings in a regular expression; and the <b>$</b> symbol looks like it belongs at the 
   beginning of a scalar. Also, the <b>$</b> anchor doesn't <i>quite</i> mean "match at end of string." 
   In fact, it means, "match at end of string <i>or</i> before an end-of-line that is followed by end of 
   string."  Try this one-liner and you'll see the difference: </p>
   
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~/perl3$ <ins>perl -le '$_="kumquat\n"; print "\$ matches" if /t$/; print "\\z does not match" unless /t\z/'</ins>
$ matches
\z does not match
</pre></div></div>
   
  <p><b>$</b> is equivalent to the regex subexpression <b>(?:\n\z|\z)</b>. And just for 
   symmetry, the <b>\Z</b> anchor was introduced to mean the same thing.  Extend your previous one-liner 
   as shown:</p>
   
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~/perl3$ perl -le '$_="kumquat\n"; print "\$ matches" if /t$/; print "\\z does not match" unless /t\z/<ins>; print "But \\Z *does* match" if /t\Z/</ins>'
$ matches
\z does not match
But \Z *does* match</pre></div></div>
   
  <p>At first glance, it may seem confusing to have an anchor that matches either end of string or before a 
   newline followed by end of string. But in fact, it's actually really useful. Most 
   programmers forget that the anchor may match before a newline, because they will often read a line into a 
   scalar and not <span class="darkgreen">chomp()</span> it, so the newline on the end isn't important to them.
   Having <b>$</b> match before that newline means <span class="darkgreen">chomp()</span> is optional.</p>
   
  <p>We are left with these best practices:</p>
   
  <ol><li>For matching beginning and end of string, use <b>\A</b> and <b>\z</b> respectively.</li><li>For matching the end of string <i>or</i> before a newline followed by end of string, use <b>\Z</b>.</li><li>Much code that you encounter will use <b>^</b> and <b>$</b> instead of <b>\A</b> and 
    <b>\Z</b> respectively; that's okay. </li><li>If you want to match the beginning of a <i>line,</i> use the <b>^</b> anchor with the <b>/m</b> 
    modifier.</li><li>If you want to match the end of a <i>line,</i> use the <b>$</b> anchor with the <b>/m</b> modifier.</li></ol>
      
  <p>Go ahead and read over the <b>multimatch.pl</b> example we started and make sure you can follow it. 
   Note in particular how we used the <b>/g</b> flag to get a list of everything matching 
   in the capturing parentheses. </p>
   
  <p>Now let's try a Perl one-liner. Type the command below as shown:</p>
   
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~/perl3$ <ins>perl -0ne 'print "$_\n" for /^(\w+)$/mg' *</ins>
<i>(output will vary ...)</i>
cold:~/perl3$ <ins>cd ..</ins>
cold:~/perl3$ 
</pre></div></div>
   
  <p>That will print out all the lines in all the files in the current directory that consist <i>solely</i>
   of word characters. You'll see the line <b>__END__</b> from <b>multimatch.pl</b>. 
   How does it work?</p>
   
  <p>The <b>-0</b> command-line flag to Perl (that's a zero, not a letter "Oh," by the way) works similarly to the 
   <b>join '',...</b> in <b>multimatch.pl</b> to read the whole data section into a single string. 
   It tells Perl that its <i>input record separator</i> is no longer <b>\n</b>, but instead the 
   <i>null character</i> (the character with ASCII value 0). That character doesn't occur at all in any of the 
   files in the current directory, so 
   the <b>-n</b> flag results in each entire file being read in to <b>$_</b> in a single string.</p> 
  
  <p>When we print a match, we need to enter <b>\n</b> explicitly, because we didn't use the 
   <b>-l</b> flag to add a newline to <span class="darkgreen">print()</span> statements. Why not? Because <b>-l</b> 
   actually adds the <i>input record separator</i> to the end of <span class="darkgreen">print()</span> statements. 
   Ordinarily that would be a newline, but not this time.</p>
   
  <p>The <b>-0</b> flag can do even more than I've shown here; see <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/perlrun.html" target="_blank">perldoc perlrun</a> for details.</p>
   
    
  <p><div class="c"><table class="noteBox fBox pBox "><tr><td class="noteTitle">Note</td><td class="note"> You may have gathered by now that Perl one-liners can be really powerful. They can also 
   be really cryptic. I am introducing them frequently now to inspire you to 
   create them yourself to solve real problems. It may take you a while to 
   craft a one-liner to solve a problem initially, and you may wonder if it's worth all the effort. It is. When 
   you become familiar 
   with command-line flags such as <b>-0</b>, regular expressions, and the match and

 <a name="h_02"></a><div class="heading">The /s Modifier</div><div class="headingText">
   
  <p>The <b>/m</b> modifier is similar to the <b>/s</b> modifier. You can think of <b>/s</b> as  
   "single line" in that it changes the meaning of the character class shortcut <b>.</b> (the period symbol) so that it  
   matches <i>any</i> character. Normally <b>.</b> is synonymous with 
   <b>[^\n]</b>; that is, "match any character <i>except</i> the newline." When parsing text containing several lines, 
   it is very common to want to contain a match to within a single line. Let's try an example. Create 
   <b>report_parse.pl</b> in your <b>/perl3</b> folder as shown:</p>
   
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE:</div><div class="listing"><pre>#!/usr/bin/perl

  <p>If <b>.</b> matched any character <i>including</i> newline, that regex would have a significant problem; 
   the greedy <b>*</b> would match everything from <b>Fred</b> up to the <b>12.50</b> in 
   the <i>last</i> line.</p>
  
  <p>Before we go any further, let me clarify a couple of things. First, when solving real problems, you're 
   not likely to have the actual data for the problem in the file itself. But in our course, 
   we put data in files in many examples to save 
   you from having to create or copy separate data files. You use the <b>&lt;&gt;</b> operator to read 
   from files named on the command line.</p>
  
  <p>Second, this program reads multiple lines into <b>$_</b> in one pass and then uses a regex to parse 
   <b>$_</b>, one line at a time. That's not very efficient. Imagine that instead of having the line assign to 
   <b>$_</b>, you were handed a variable containing the multiline report from some source outside of your 
   control.</p>
    
  <p>So when is the right time to use <b>/s</b>? <i>Not</i> using <b>/s</b> is useful when parsing line-oriented input because <b>.</b> 
   can't "run off the end of the line." But what about when you're parsing something that <i>isn't</i> line oriented, like HTML 
   (and this is again subject to the earlier caveat about parsing HTML in general)? This is where /s can be useful. A newline can 
   occur anywhere there's white space. But you need to parse it by matching beginning and ending tags, and there may be other 
   intervening tags you'll want to ignore. Let's try an example. Create <b>parse_courses.pl</b> in your <b>/perl3</b> folder as shown:</p>
  
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE:</div><div class="listing"><pre>#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

$_ = join '', &lt;DATA&gt;;

  <p>Our example gave us some ugly HTML! Usually it is best to parse text line by line, but when the 
   tokens you're looking for may be split across lines, you have no choice but to parse the entire document. 
   This also gives you the freedom to make multiple passes through the data (as we did here with an 
   initial scan) to find the value in the &lt;BASE&gt; tag.</p>
   
  <p>Let's take a closer look at that regex. To help with that, we'll  
   introduce another helpful modifier.</p>
  
 </div>
 <a href="Perl3-06.html" name="x_modifier"></a>
 <a name="h_03"></a><div class="heading">The /x Modifier</div><div class="headingText">
   
  <p>The <b>/x</b> modifier will come as a welcome relief if you have been going cross-eyed looking at dense 
   regular expressions to mentally parse every character in them. The <b>/x</b> modifier allows you to embed comments in your 
   regexes, and it also makes white space insignificant. This means that you will be able to format and 
   comment regexes just like regular program code—of course regexes <i>are</i> code. </p>

  <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it. You'll get the same results as before. We 
   haven't changed the meaning of our code at all; all we've done is add comments. Yes, comments inside a regular 
   expression. Now you can see what the regex is doing more clearly, and spot 
   potential bugs and improvements.</p>
    
  <p><b>/x</b> means that newlines, spaces, and tabs lose their literal match meaning and are instead ignored, so 
   we can use them for indentation and breaking the regex across multiple lines. If we had had any literal 
   spaces in the regex, we would have had to replace them, typically with <b>\s</b>. If 
   we wanted to match just a space character, we would have had to replace them with a backslashed space character. (Newlines and tabs can 
   be matched with <b>\n</b> and <b>\t</b> respectively.)</p>
    
  <p><b>/x</b> also means that a <b>#</b> sign and anything after it on the same line are ignored, so if you 
   wanted to match a literal <b>#</b> sign, you'd have to backslash it too.</p>
  
  <p>Some programmers believe that <b>/x</b> is so useful that they include it in 
   <i>every</i> regex they write.  You can use it on everything you write from now on if you like; we will use 
   it specifically where we feel it helps.</p>

 <a name="h_04"></a><div class="heading">The /e Modifier</div><div class="headingText">
   
  <p>The <b>/e</b> modifier is different from all the others that we've seen so far in that it can only be 
   used on the <i>substitution</i> operator, because it does not affect the interpretation of the regular 
   expression, but instead affects the interpretation of the replacement string.</p>
   
  <p>The <b>/e</b> stands for <i>evaluate</i>; it causes the replacement string to be compiled and 
   executed as Perl code. This can take some getting used to, so let's start by using a one-liner 
   without the <b>/e</b> modifier. Type the command as shown:</p>
 
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~/perl3$ <ins>perl -wle '$_="pot"; print; s/o/"i"/; print'</ins>
pot
p"i"t
</pre></div></div>
 
  <p>Now add the <b>/e</b> modifier:</p>
 
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~/perl3$ perl -wle '$_="pot"; print; s/o/"i"/<ins>e</ins>; print'
pot
pit
</pre></div></div>
 
  <p>When the code <b>"i"</b> is evaluated as Perl, it is interpreted as 
   a double-quoted string with a value of <b>i</b>, so that gets used as the replacement 
   string. </p>
 
  <p>Of course the real power of <b>/e</b> is exercised when we use it to substitute a string that varies 
   according to what was matched.  Create <b>incr.pl</b> in your <b>/perl3</b> folder as shown: </p>

  <p>This program prints out its data section with its URLs replaced by a small block that includes the URL 
   and its length, or an error message. Let's walk through it together and see how it works:</p>
 
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE:</div><div class="observe"><pre>
s!<span class="green">(</span><span class="darkblue">http://</span>://.*?<span class="green">)</span><span class="red">(</span><span class="darkgreen">\s</span><span class="purple">|</span><span class="darkred">$</span><span class="red">)</span>!
</pre></div></div>
 
  <p>We look for URLs that begin with <span class="darkblue">http://</span> and, by using the parentheses 
   <span class="green">()</span>, save them into <b>$1</b>. URLs can include all sorts of characters, so we say that ours ends 
   when we see either a whitespace character (<span class="darkgreen">\s</span>), or (<span class="purple">|</span>) the end of 
   the line (<span class="darkred">$</span>). By using the second set of parentheses <span class="red">()</span>, we save that into 
   <b>$2</b>.</p>
 
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE:</div><div class="observe"><pre>
!<span class="blue">visit(</span><span class="darkblue">$1</span><span class="blue">)</span>.<span class="red">$2</span>!ge
</pre></div></div>
 
  <p>Our replacement string starts with the result of calling the subroutine <span class="blue">visit()</span>, passing the 
   URL we saved (<span class="darkblue">$1</span>). We put back the whitespace character we matched from <span class="red">$2</span>, so we don't delete any 
   spaces. (There is a feature of regular expressions outside the scope of this course called "lookahead"
   that allows you to match something without consuming it; you can read about it in <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/perlre.html" target="_blank">perldoc perlre</a>.</p>
 
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE:</div><div class="observe"><pre>
or next;
</pre></div></div>
 
  <p>Just to remind you of the result of a substitution, we won't print any lines that don't match.</p>
 
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE:</div><div class="observe"><pre>
`curl -s $url 2&gt;&amp;1`
</pre></div></div>
 
  <p>The <b>-s</b> flag to <b>curl</b> tells it not to output statistics. The <b>2&gt;&amp;1</b> construct 
   tells the shell invoked by the backticks to redirect any errors from <b>curl</b> to standard output so they 
   will go into <b>$content</b>. It is common to add to commands executed with 
   backticks. If you don't do that, anything the external command sends to standard error will go wherever 
   standard error is set—most likely the terminal. The intention of backticks is to intercept whatever the 
   program outputs, and usually, we want that to include errors as well. </p>
 
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE:</div><div class="observe"><pre>
<span class="red">$?</span> and return
</pre></div></div>

  <p>The special variable <span class="red">$?</span> is set by Perl to the exit status of the command that was last executed
    by <span class="darkgreen">system</span> or backticks. A successful program will have an exit code of zero. We will
    assume that any other code returned by <b>curl</b> means that it was not able to retrieve the URL.</p>
 
  <p>Isn't that cool?  And here's something even cooler. Create <b>double_eval.pl</b> in your 
   <b>/perl3</b> folder as shown:</p>
 
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE:</div><div class="listing"><pre>#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

$_ = join '', &lt;DATA&gt;;
s/([\d+*\/-]+)\s*=/qq{"$1 = " . ($1)}/eeg;
print;

__END__
1+2/4= and 42**3 =
 and 12-3/4 =
</pre></div></div>
 
  <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it:</p>

<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~/perl3$ <ins>./double_eval.pl</ins>
1+2/4 = 1.5 and 42**3 = 74088
 and 12-3/4 = 11.25
</pre></div></div>
 
  <p>Wow! This program outputs the result of arithmetic expressions in the text itself! But why is the 
   <b>/e</b> modifier repeated? What happens if you leave it off? Try it! Modify your code as shown:</p>

<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE:</div><div class="listing"><pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

$_ = join '', &lt;DATA&gt;;
s/([\d+*\/-]+)\s*=/qq{"$1 = " . ($1)}/<del>e</del>eg;
print;

__END__
1+2/4= and 42**3 =
 and 12-3/4 =
</pre></div></div>
 
  <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it:</p>

<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~/perl3$ <ins>./double_eval.pl</ins>
"1+2/4 = " . (1+2/4) and "42**3 = " . (42**3)
 and "12-3/4 = " . (12-3/4)
</pre></div></div>
 
  <p>That's not so good, is it. The problem here is that we want Perl to do the work of evaluating the 
   expression itself. So once we have captured the expression into a scalar, using <b>/e</b> to output 
   that scalar has the effect you see above. We want Perl to evaluate the expression <i>again</i>, and we are allowed to repeat
   the <b>/e</b> modifier to get that effect.</p>
 
  <p>But if we're going to evaluate the replacement string again, then our replacement string needs to be
   <i>code that generates code</i>. Here's how it works: Take an expression like <b>1+2/4</b>. That 
   gets saved into <span class="red">$1</span>. The replacement string is <b>qq{"$1 = " . ($1)}</b>. The <i>first</i> 
   <b>/e</b> modifier means that the replacement string (including the quotation marks), gets evaluated, yielding the result 
   <b>"1+2/4 = " . (1+2/4)</b>. The <i>second</i> <b>/e</b> modifier 
   means that the previous result gets evaluated, yielding the result <b>1+2/4 = 1.5</b>.</p>
 
  <p>By working backwards from the result you want, you can write these kinds of double-<b>/e</b> 
   substitutions yourself. They don't come up often as practical solutions, but when they do, they are 
   incredibly useful.</p>
  
  <p>You're making great progress. Feel free to direct any questions you may have to your instructor. Keep up the good work and 
   see you in the next lesson!</p>
