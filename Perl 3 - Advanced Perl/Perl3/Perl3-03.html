 <p>Welcome back! In this lesson we'll learn ways that your Perl 
  program interacts with the system, by accessing the process environment 
  and by running external programs. </p>
 

 
 <a href="Perl3-03.html" name="environment"></a>
 <a name="h_01"></a><div class="heading">The Environment</div><div class="headingText">
   
  <p>Every process that runs has an available <i>environment</i>. The environment contains a number 
   of <i>variables</i> that are places to store information. You can access the list of variables contained in an environment
   on Unix with the 
   <b>env</b> command, and on Windows with the <b>set</b> command. Try the <b>env</b> command on our system.
   At your <b>cold:~$</b> prompt, type the command below as shown:</p>
   
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>
cold:~$ <ins>env</ins>
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p>You'll see output that looks like this:</p>

<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE:</div><div class="observe"><pre>
PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/X11R6/bin

</pre></div></div>
   
   <p>The output you get could be a lot different from the output you see in
    the box above, because I ran my command on a
    Mac (<b>env</b> is useful for discovering which kind of system you're running).</p>
   
   <p>The output is a series of lines in this format: <i>variable=value</i>. The <i>variable</i> is the name of 
    a variable, the <i>value</i> is the content of that variable. You can use any one of these pairs of <i>variable=value</i> pairs 
    at the command line, much 
    like a Perl variable:</p>
   
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>
cold:~$ <ins>echo $TERM</ins>
xterm
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p>And you can change or create environment variables yourself, like this:</p>
   
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>
cold:~$ <ins>export FOOD=chocolate</ins>
cold:~$ <ins>echo $FOOD</ins>
chocolate
</pre></div></div>
    
  <p>Most of the time, environment variables are used to pass information to <i>child processes</i>. Initially, we set an 
   environment variable at the command line (like <b>FOOD</b> above). The child processes are all of the 
   programs that you invoke from the same shell (terminal window)—in our classes, those 
   are usually Perl programs. The variables that are there already were set by various scripts that are 
   configured to run every time you start a shell or log in to the system.</p>
   
  <p>Environment variables are <i>inherited</i> by child processes. If, after 
   entering the command above, you were to start a child shell, and then run <b>env</b>, you'd see that it already had the variable 
   <b>FOOD</b> set to <b>chocolate</b>.</p>
     
  <p>But enough about shell commands—we're here to learn how to work in <i>Perl! </i>
   Perl has a special hash that is mapped to the environment. It's called <b>%ENV</b>. Each 
   key is a variable name. If you change an entry in the hash, Perl changes the environment; this is one of 
   the "magic" variables in Perl.</p>
   
  <p>Let's try it out. Type the one-liner below as shown:</p>
   
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>
cold:~$ <ins>perl -le 'print "$_ = $ENV{$_}" for sort keys %ENV'</ins>
</pre></div></div>
   
  <p>You get more or less the same environment variables you got from <b>env</b> in the shell. 
   (Any differences are the results of the shell setting or changing variables as it started a new child process to 
   run Perl.)</p>
   
  <p>A common mistake programmers make is attempting to change the environment of a <i>parent</i> process. 
   It's impossible to do this from Perl or <i>any other</i> programming language. Try it: </p>
  
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>
cold:~$ <ins>perl -e '$ENV{FOOD} = "Vanilla"'</ins>
cold:~$ <ins>env | sort</ins>
</pre></div></div>
   
  <p>Notice that <b>FOOD</b> is still set to <b>chocolate</b> from our previous entry in the output (which 
   we piped through <b>sort</b> to make it easier to search).
   
  That's how the environment works. When you use it in a Perl program, 
   most of the time you'll be reading a variable that was set by a parent process. (Once in a while you'll 
   set a variable that will be read by a child process—more on that later in the lesson).</p>
   
  <p>An environment variable of special note is <b>PATH</b>. This variable contains a  
   ordered list of paths to search for programs that are not found in the 
   current directory and are run without specifying an absolute or relative path. So, when you type <b>ls</b>, for 
   example, at the command line, your shell looks through each of the directories named in <b>PATH</b> until 
   it finds one that contains the executable file <b>ls</b>, at which point it runs that file. We can use Perl to 
   tell us where it located that program! Run this one-liner:</p>
   
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>
cold:~$ <ins>perl -le 'my $prog = shift or die; print $_, -x "$_/$prog" ? " &lt;-- HERE" : "" for split /:/, $ENV{PATH}' ls</ins>
</pre></div></div>
   
  <p>Your output will look something like this:</p>
   
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE:</div><div class="observe"><pre>
/usr/kerberos/bin
/usr/local/bin
/bin &lt;-- HERE
/usr/bin
/usr/X11R6/bin
/usr/local/java/bin
/users/pscott/bin
</pre></div></div>
   
  <p>Congratulations!  You've just invented a streamlined version of the system utility <b>whereis</b>.
   Now try running that one-liner a few more times, each time replacing <b>ls</b> with one of the programs here:</p>
   
  <ul><li>jdb</li><li>php</li><li>perl</li><li>sclient</li></ul>
   
  <p>You could of course write that one-liner out as a program in a file, particularly if you wanted to 
   call it again (although in its present form it could easily be assigned to a shell alias). If you find it 
   more concise than you would like, I encourage you to rewrite it as a program. It is important that you 
   understand all the code we create, whether it's in the form of a program or a one-liner. Sometimes you 
   need to read a one-liner very carefully to understand it, but that's an important skill too, because
   one-liners are a common use of Perl and it's vital that you are comfortable both with reading and writing 
   them.</p>   
  
  <p>You can see that some programs exist in more than one directory—that's handy to know; maybe the 
   programs are different. When you just type the name of the program at the command prompt, you'll only ever 
   execute the <i>first</i> one in your path.</p>

  <p><div class="c"><table class="noteBox fBox pBox "><tr><td class="noteTitle">Note</td><td class="note">The term "path" has several different meanings in the Unix world; this could cause confusion. 
   The context helps you to figure out which meaning is intended. Sometimes path refers to 
   the address of a file, such as <b>/etc/passwd</b>, <b>public_html/images/squirrel472.jpg</b>,
   <b>../sibling/cousin.txt</b>, or <b>todo.list</b>. The first path example, <b>/etc/passwd</b>, is an <i>absolute</i> path, 
   because it refers to the same file regardless of your current directory. The next 
   two examples, <b>public_html/images/squirrel472.jpg</b> and
   <b>../sibling/cousin.txt</b>, are 
   <i>relative</i> paths, which are found by starting from the current directory. The last address in the 
   list, <b>todo.list</b>, refers to a file in the current directory; it is the same as the relative path <b>./todo.list</b>. 
   Generally, we refer to the last component (like <b>cousin.txt</b>) as a <i>filename</i>, but it is also a 
   (degenerate) case of a "path."<br><br>
   
   We've introduced the environment variable PATH, or in Perl, <b>$ENV{PATH}</b>. In this context, path refers 
   to an ordered set of directories to search whenever the name of a program is typed at the command line 
   without a directory as part of the name. In this case, the bare file name refers 
   to a file in the current directory only if the '<b>.</b>' (period) is present in PATH and the file does not occur in a directory named 
   earlier in PATH.</td></tr></table></div></p>

 <a name="h_02"></a><div class="heading">The system Command</div><div class="headingText">
   
  <p>Now let's see how we can run a separate program from a Perl program. Some programmers do this far too 
   much. For instance, they run the Unix <b>date</b> program from Perl and parse the result to get the date, 
   instead of doing it more efficiently from directly inside Perl with the <span class="darkgreen">localtime()</span> 
   function. In general, whenever you think you need to run an external program to execute a task, 
   consider whether there is a way to do it from Perl itself. There are modules available to perform 
   just about any task conceivable. </p>
   
  <p>Our first examples of the <span class="darkgreen">system()</span> function can be done in pure Perl, but 
   we'll set that aside for this lesson. Suppose that your program used a lot of time to create an 
   entire directory tree of temporary files under <b>/tmp/myprog</b>, and you want to remove all of them.  
   Rather than going through all of the subdirectories that might have been created (and rather than use the 
   <b>File::Path module</b>, which provides the <span class="darkgreen">remove_tree()</span> function for this purpose), 
   we'll call on the recursive flag of the system's <b>rm</b> command to do it for us. Check it out:</p>
   
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: system</div><div class="observe"><pre>
system "rm -r /tmp/myprog";
</pre></div></div>
  
  <p>You could use parentheses around the arguments, but most programmers don't.
   When you run <span class="darkgreen">system()</span> (<i>command</i>), the information that <i>command</i> sends to standard 
   output and standard error will appear on your terminal (unless you've already redirected those streams). 
   Similarly, if the command gets data from standard input, the command retrieves that data from the same 
   source that standard input is currently using.</p>
   
  <p>Let's try to use the <span class="darkgreen">system()</span> function in a
    program. Create <b>edit.pl</b> in your <b>/perl3</b> folder as shown:</p>
   
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE:</div><div class="listing"><pre>#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

my $temp_file = "$ENV{'HOME'}/.edit.pl.$$";
unlink $temp_file; # In case I left one lying around

my $date = localtime;
{
  open my $fh, '&gt;', $temp_file or die "open $temp_file: $!\n";
  print {$fh} &lt;&lt;"END_OF_TEXT";
This file was written on $date by $0.
Here's your chance to customize it!
END_OF_TEXT
}

print "Stand by to edit!\n";
system "vi $temp_file";

print "Contents of $temp_file are now:\n";
{
  open my $fh, '&lt;', $temp_file or die "open $temp_file: $!\n";
  print while &lt;$fh&gt;;
}
unlink $temp_file;
</pre></div></div>
   
  <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it. This program brings you to the <b>vi</b> 
   editor so you can edit the temporary file that was created. Here are a few tips for accessing and editing in the <b>vi</b>
   editor:</p>
   
   <ul><li>To get into insert mode, type <b>i</b>.</li><li>To get out of insert mode, press the <b>Esc</b> key.</li><li>To save and close the file, press <b>:</b> and then type <b>x</b>. </li></ul>
   <p>You can use the <span class="darkgreen">system()</span> function in 
   the same way to allow your users to edit and customize output files in the middle of a program, for example, to 
   customize a report before it is emailed.</p> 
   <p>Programmers usually set the environment 
   variable <b>EDITOR</b> globally to contain the program name of their favorite editor on the system.</p>
  <p>Okay. Let's go ahead and edit the file. Run the command below as shown:</p>
   
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>
cold:~$ <ins>cd perl3</ins>
cold:~/perl3$ <ins>export EDITOR=emacs</ins>
</pre></div></div>
 
  <p><div class="c"><table class="noteBox fBox pBox "><tr><td class="noteTitle">Note</td><td class="note">When you close and restart the terminal session, the variable will change back to its 
   default.</td></tr></table></div></p>
  
  <p>Now change your program to recognize the EDITOR variable. Add the <ins>blue</ins> code and delete the <del>red</del> code 
   as shown:</p>
   
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE:</div><div class="listing"><pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

my $temp_file = "$ENV{HOME}/.edit.pl.$$";
unlink $temp_file; # In case I left one lying around

my $date = localtime;
{
  open my $fh, '&gt;', $temp_file or die "open $temp_file: $!\n";
  print {$fh} &lt;&lt;"END_OF_TEXT";
This file was written on $date by $0.
Here's your chance to customize it!
END_OF_TEXT
}

print "Stand by to edit!\n";
<del>system "vi $temp_file";</del>
<ins>my $editor = $ENV{EDITOR} || 'vi';
system "$editor $temp_file";</ins>

print "Contents of $temp_file are now:\n";
{
  open my $fh, '&lt;', $temp_file or die "open $temp_file: $!\n";
  print while &lt;$fh&gt;;
}
unlink $temp_file;  
</pre></div></div>
   
  <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it. The file opens in emacs. Add some text,
   and save the change by pressing <b>Ctrl+x</b> and then <b>Ctrl+s</b>. Exit emacs by pressing <b>Ctrl+x</b> 
   and then <b>Ctrl+c</b>.</p> 
   
  <p>The <span class="darkgreen">system()</span> function has rules about whether it passes its argument to the
   shell for interpretation. If there is only one argument and it contains shell metacharacters—characters
   that the shell interprets in a particular way—then it will be run through a shell. A common use of this 
   feature is to run a command and ignore its output. Create <b>grep.pl</b> in your <b>/perl3</b> folder as 
   shown:</p>

<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE:</div><div class="listing"><pre>#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

my $string = shift or die "Usage: $0 string [file]\n";
my $file   = shift || $0;
system "grep $string $file";
print "$string ", $? == 0 ? "was" : "wasn't", " found in $file\n";
</pre></div></div>
   
  <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it as shown (changing to your <b>/perl3</b> 
   folder if necessary):</p>
   
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>
cold:~/perl3$ <ins>./grep.pl</ins>

cold:~/perl3$ <ins>./grep.pl perl</ins>
#!/usr/bin/perl
perl was found in ./perl3/grep.pl
cold:~/perl3$ <ins>./grep.pl qqq</ins>
qqq wasn't found in ./grep.pl
</pre></div></div>
   
  <p>Our program uses another feature of Perl to find out the <i>exit status</i> of the <b>grep</b> 
   program: the special variable <b>$?</b>, which contains the exit status of the last program to be run 
   via <span class="darkgreen">system()</span>. By convention, programs exit with a code of zero to indicate success. 
   <b>grep</b> exits with a non-zero code when it doesn't find the search expression in the text it's 
   searching. (In this program, the default file being searched is the program itself.) We're being a little bit lazy here 
   in using <b>grep</b> to tell us whether a certain string (or regular expression) is contained in a file, 
   rather than writing the equivalent Perl code for that purpose. It's also less than elegant; 
   <b>grep</b> prints out the lines that match, and they get 
   in the way. You can provide <b>grep</b> with an option that allows it to suppress those lines, but let's pretend we don't know 
   about it for now. Instead, we'll redirect that output to <b>/dev/null</b> so we don't see it. Modify your code as shown:</p>
  
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE:</div><div class="listing"><pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

my $string = shift or die "Usage: $0 string [file]\n";
my $file   = shift || $0;
system "grep $string $file <ins>&gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1</ins>";
print "$string ", $? == 0 ? "was" : "wasn't", " found in $file\n";
   </pre></div></div>
   
  <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it again with the same inputs:</p>
    
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>
cold:~/perl3$ <ins>./grep.pl perl</ins>
perl was found in ./grep.pl
cold:~/perl3$ <ins>./grep.pl qqq</ins>
qqq wasn't found in ./grep.pl
</pre></div></div>
    
  <p>Here we redirect both standard output and standard error to <b>/dev/null</b>. This is standard Bourne
   shell syntax. Because the metacharacters <b>&amp;</b> and <b>&gt;</b> 
   are in the string passed to <span class="darkgreen">system()</span>, Perl passes the command through the 
   shell so those characters get interpreted according to your instructions.</p>
  
 </div>
 <a href="Perl3-03.html" name="exec"></a>
 <a name="h_03"></a><div class="heading">exec</div><div class="headingText">
   
  <p>The <span class="darkgreen">exec()</span> function is closely related to <span class="darkgreen">system()</span>. The two functions operate
   identically except that <span class="darkgreen">exec()</span> causes the current process to be <i>replaced</i> by the one being invoked. 
   Think of <span class="darkgreen">exec()</span> <span class="red">@args</span> as a shorthand for this: </p>

  <p>...except <span class="darkgreen">exec</span> <span class="red">@args</span>

   format and output help text embedded in <i>our own program</i>, for when the user wants help. Let's give that a try. Create

   <i>Perl</i>). It is in a format called <b>POD</b> (Plain Old Documentation, a highly technical term), which <b>perldoc</b> 
   understands. An in-depth discussion of POD syntax is outside the scope of this course (you can read about it in 
   <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/perlpod.html" target="_blank">http://perldoc.perl.org/perlpod.html</a>), but I'm using POD here anyway, because it's a pretty cool use of

  <p><span class="darkgreen">system()</span> and <span class="darkgreen">exec()</span> have worked well for us so far, but suppose
   we want to get at the <i>output</i> of a program. We need something that will capture whatever that

  <p>You can use the <span class="darkgreen">open</span> function to open a pipe to or from a program, and read 
   from or write to that pipe from Perl. Let's start with an example that reads the lines that are output by the 
   program <b>last</b>, a standard Unix program that reports the time of a user's last login. It generates output 
   that looks like this:</p>
   
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE:</div><div class="observe"><pre>

[... more similar lines...]

  <p>The first word on each line is the username, eventually followed by the date. Now suppose we want a 
   program that prints the first line listed by <b>last</b> for each distinct username; in other words, shows 
   us the last time each user known to the <b>last</b> program logged on. Create <span class="darkred">last.pl</span> 
   as shown:</p>
   
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE:</div><div class="listing"><pre>#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

open my $fh, '-|', "last" or die "Can't open pipe: $!\n";
my %seen;
while ( &lt;$fh&gt; )
{
  next unless /\A(\S+).*\s((?:[A-Z][a-z]{2} ){2}[ \d]\d \d\d:\d\d)/;
  print "$1 - $2\n" unless $seen{$1}++;
}
</pre></div></div>
   
  <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it. The output will look something like 
   this:</p>
   
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE:</div><div class="observe"><pre>

  <p>The form of the <i>piped open</i> for input from a program is:</p>

<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE:</div><div class="observe"><pre>
open <span class="purple">filehandle</span>, <span class="darkblue">'-|'</span>, <span class="darkred">program</span>
</pre></div></div>
   
  <p>Take a look at the mode <span class="darkblue">'-|'</span> here where we have previously had <span class="darkgreen">open</span> 
   modes of &lt;, or &gt;, or &gt;&gt;.  Using the <b>-|</b> mode, <span class="darkred">program</span> will be run and its 
   standard output will be connected to <span class="purple">filehandle</span>. </p>
   
  <p>Using the <b>-|</b> mode you can
   start reading output as soon as it becomes 
   available. With backticks, you have to wait for the program to finish running before you can get <i>any</i> of the 
   output.</p>
   
  <p>The regular expression here is worth studying too. We can't just <span class="darkgreen">split</span> 
   the line on white space, because sometimes the second column contains a space ("system boot"). We could
   unpack the fixed-width columns, but instead we craft a regular expression to
   match the date and time.  See if you can figure out how it works!</p>
   
  <p>You can also open a pipe <i>to</i> a program, so that whatever you write on that filehandle goes to the
    standard input of the program. The form for that looks  like this:</p>
   
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE:</div><div class="observe"><pre>
open <i>filehandle</i>, '|-', <i>program</i>
</pre></div></div>
   
  <p>Let's try an example! Create <span class="darkred">od.pl</span> as shown:</p>
   
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE:</div><div class="listing"><pre>#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

open my $fh, '|-', 'od -c' or die "open: $!\n";
print {$fh} "Hello world! \e \a \b \r \n";
close $fh;
</pre></div></div>
   
  <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it as shown here:</p>
   
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>
cold:~/perl3$ <ins>./od.pl</ins>
0000000   H   e   l   l   o       w   o   r   l   d   !     033      \a
0000020      \b      \r      \n
0000026
</pre></div></div>
   
  <p>This is a basic example of a piped open for output. We sent a fixed string to the <b>od</b>
   program, which is designed to display data that may contain unprintable characters in a form that shows 
   their octal code or other representation. Here, the printable characters have been rendered 
   explicitly; the <b>od</b> program knows symbolic forms for all of the digraphs I used except for the <b>\e</b> 
   for the ESCAPE character.</p>
   
  <p><div class="c"><table class="noteBox fBox pBox "><tr><td class="noteTitle">Note</td><td class="note"> You cannot open a pipe to a program for <i>both</i> reading and writing. (In other words, there 
   is no <b>-|-</b> mode.)</td></tr></table></div></p>
  
  <p>The special variable <span class="red">$?</span> is also set to the exit status of a program that is run
   via backticks or a piped open.</p>
  
  <p>Phew! That was a pretty long lesson, but worth the trip. Now that you have a handle on ways to access the process environment 
   and by run external programs, you're ready to take on regular expressions! We'll do that in the next lesson! See you in there...</p>

   <p>Don't forget to go back to the syllabus to complete the homework.</p>
