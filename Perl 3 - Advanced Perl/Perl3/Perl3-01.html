    <p>If you completed 
      OST's Perl 1 or Perl 2 courses, then we've already met. But in case you haven't, my name is 
      Peter Scott, and I have been using and teaching Perl for over a dozen years. I'm the author of the books 
      <i>Perl Debugged</i> and <i>Perl Medic</i>, as well as the DVD/video <i>Perl Fundamentals</i>. I've taught Perl 
      in person to hundreds of people. I 
      love Perl, and I sincerely want you to enjoy learning more about Perl from this course. 
      We are always working to improve our courses to give students the best experience possible. 
      And we rely on our students' help to reach that goal. I encourage you to let your instructor know if you see spots where the 
      course could be improved, and also parts that you found particularly
      effective (so we know not to mess with those bits). We always appreciate your feedback!</p>
  </div>
  
  <p> In this course, written by well-known Perl trainer and author Peter Scott, you'll enter a new level of Perl expertise 
    as you build upon skills learned in Perl 2.</p>
 <a name="h_01"></a><div class="heading">Learning with O'Reilly School of Technology Courses</div><div class="headingText">  
  <p>As with every O'Reilly School of Technology course, we'll take a <i>user-active</i> 
    approach to learning. This means that you (the user) will be active! You'll learn by doing,  
    building live programs, testing them and experimenting with themâ€”hands-on!</p>
  
  <p>To learn a new skill or technology, you have to experiment. The more you experiment, the more 
    you learn. Our system is designed to maximize experimentation and help you <i>learn to 
      learn</i> a new skill.</p>
  
  <p>We'll program as much as possible to be sure that the principles sink in and stay with you.</p>
  
  <p>Each time we discuss a new concept, you'll put it into code and see what YOU can do with it.  
   On occasion we'll even give you code that doesn't work, so you can see common mistakes and how 
   to recover from them. Making mistakes is actually another good way to learn.</p>  
    
  <p>Above all, we want to help you to <i>learn to learn</i>. We give you the tools to take control 
    of your own learning experience. </p>

  <p>When you complete an OST course, you know the subject matter, <i>and</i> you know how to 
    expand your knowledge, so you can handle changes like software and operating system updates.</p>
   
   <p>Here are some tips for using O'Reilly School of Technology courses effectively:</p>

  <ul><li><b>Type the code.</b> Resist the temptation to cut and paste the example code we give you. 
    Typing the code  
      actually gives you a feel for the programming task. Then play around with the examples to find out what 
      else you can make them do, and to check your understanding. It's highly
      unlikely you'll break anything by experimentation. If you <i>do</i> break something, that's an indication to us that 
      we need to improve our system!</li><li><b>Take your time.</b> Learning takes time. Rushing can have negative effects on your 
      progress. Slow down and let your brain absorb the new information thoroughly. 
      Taking your time helps to maintain a relaxed, positive approach. It also gives you the 
      chance to try new things and learn more than you otherwise would if you blew 
      through all of the coursework too quickly.</li><li><b>Experiment.</b> Wander from the path often and explore the possibilities. We can't 
      anticipate all of your questions and ideas, so it's up to you to experiment and create on 
      your own. Your instructor will help if you go completely off the rails.</li><li><b>Accept guidance, but don't depend on it.</b> Try to solve problems on your own. Going 
      from misunderstanding to understanding is the best way to acquire a new skill. Part of what 
      you're learning is problem solving. Of course, you can always contact your instructor 
      for hints when you need them.</li><li><b>Use all available resources!</b> In real-life problem-solving, you aren't bound by false 
      limitations; in OST courses, you are free to use any resources at your disposal to solve
      problems you encounter: the Internet, reference books, and online help are all fair game.   
      </li><li><b>Have fun!</b> Relax, keep practicing, and don't be afraid to make mistakes! 
      Your instructor will keep you at it until you've 
      mastered the skill. We want you to get that satisfied, "I'm so cool! I did it!"
      feeling. And you'll have some projects to show off when you're done.</li></ul>
  </div>   
 <a name="h_01"></a><div class="heading">Lesson Format</div><div class="headingText">
        
    <p>We'll try out lots of examples in each lesson. We'll have you write code, 
    look at code, and edit existing code. The code will be presented in boxes that will 
    indicate what needs to be done to the code inside.</p>
        
    <p>Whenever you see white boxes like the one below, you'll <i>type</i> the contents into the editor window to try the example yourself. 
      The CODE TO TYPE bar on top of the white box contains directions for you to follow:</p>
        
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE:</div><div class="listing"><pre>White boxes like this contain code for you to try out (type into a file to run).

If you have already written some of the code, new code for you to add <ins>looks like this</ins>. 
    
If we want you to remove existing code, the code to remove <del>will look like this</del>.
  
<span class="gray">We may also include instructive comments that you don't need to type.</span>  
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p>We may run programs and do some other activities in a terminal session in the operating system or other command-line environment. These will be shown 
     like this:</p>
   
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>
The plain black text that we present in these INTERACTIVE boxes is 
provided by the system (not for you to type). The commands we want you to type <ins>look like this</ins>.
</pre></div></div>   
        
  <p>Code and information presented in a gray OBSERVE box is for you to <i>inspect</i> and <i>absorb</i>. 
  This information is often color-coded, and followed by text explaining the code in detail:</p>
        
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE:</div><div class="observe"><pre>
Gray "Observe" boxes like this contain <span class="darkred">information</span> (usually code specifics) for you to <i>observe</i>.
</pre></div></div>

   <p>The paragraph(s) that follow may provide addition details on <span class="darkred">information</span> that was 
     highlighted in the Observe box.</p>
   
   <p>We'll also set especially pertinent information apart in "Note" boxes:</p>      
   
   <p><div class="c"><table class="noteBox fBox pBox "><tr><td class="noteTitle">Note</td><td class="note">Notes provide information that is useful, but not absolutely necessary for performing the tasks at hand.</td></tr></table></div> </p>
   
   <p><div class="c"><table class="noteBox fBox pBox "><tr><td class="noteTitle">Tip</td><td class="note">Tips provide information that might help make the tools easier for you to use, such as shortcut keys.</td></tr></table></div></p>
   
   <p><div class="c"><table class="noteBox fBox pBox "><tr><td class="noteTitle">WARNING</td><td class="note">Warnings provide information that can help prevent program crashes and data loss.</td></tr></table></div></p>

 <a name="h_01"></a><div class="heading">The CodeRunner Screen</div><div class="headingText">
    
     <p>This course is presented in CodeRunner, OST's self-contained environment. We'll discuss the 
         details later, but here's a quick overview of the various areas of the screen:</p>
    
     <p><div class="c"><img src="../common/images/CodeRunnerScreen.png"></div></p>

 <a name="h_02"></a><div class="heading">Prerequisites</div><div class="headingText">
   
    <p>To thrive in this course, you should have either taken our 
     <a href="http://www.oreillyschool.com/courses/perl2/" target="_blank">Perl&nbsp;2</a> course or have 
     acquired the knowledge imparted by that course some other way. That course has as prerequisite our 
     <a href="http://www.oreillyschool.com/courses/perl1/" target="_blank">Perl&nbsp;1</a> course. We'll spend 
     some time in this lesson reviewing those prerequisites. (Of course, we can't review them completely; it 
     took 16 lessons in Perl&nbsp;1 and 15 lessons in Perl&nbsp;2 to cover them. But we'll give it our best 
     shot.)</p>
   
    <p>In the next sections, we provide a detailed review of the CodeRunner environment you'll be using, and 
      the topics covered in the Perl 1 and Perl 2 courses; we recommend going through both as a refresher, but 
      if you've taken Perl 2 recently or otherwise feel you don't need the review, you can skip to the next 
      section, <a href="Perl3-01.html#slices">Slices</a>.</p>
      
    <p>If you find as you review those prerequisites and the rest of this lesson that you're not sure you're 
      ready for this course, don't worryâ€”it happens. Don't give up, but don't try to struggle through 
      the course if you're not sufficiently prepared. We're happy to transfer your registration to the Perl 2 
      or Perl 1 course so you can get well-grounded in Perl. Just contact us at

    <p>You must know how to craft basic regular expressions, but this does not extend

<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE:</div><div class="observe"><pre>
if ( $line =~ /<span class="purple">[aeiou]</span>/ )

    <p>You know how to initialize, assign, and modify variables of these types. You 
       are able to declare your variables 
      with <span class="purple">my</span>, you <span class="purple">use strict</span> and <span class="purple">use warnings</span> in all 
      programs, and you understand about scoping levels created by blocks delimited by curly braces ({}), 
      whether they are blocks that are part of looping or conditional constructs, or just plain "naked" blocks. 
      You can iterate through the contents of an array and a hash, interpolate variables in double-quoted 
      strings, and use <span class="darkgreen">printf</span> for formatted printing. Let's verify those skills by 
      doing!</p> 
    
    <p>For this first example, we'll demonstrate in detail, how to create and run a program in CodeRunner. After this, 
      we'll just show you the code to type and say "Save and run it" when we want you to do this.</p>
    
    <p>First, create a <b>/perl3</b> folder for your files for this course. In the upper-left corner of the CodeRunner 
      window, select the <b>Home</b> folder, right-click it, and then select <b>New folder...</b>:</p>
      
    <p><div class="c"><img src="images/coderunner/NewFolder.png"></div></p>
      
    <p>Replace the default folder name (untitled) with <b>perl3</b> and press <b>Enter</b>:</p>

    <p><div class="c"><img src="images/coderunner/NewFolderPerl3.png"></div></p>
    
    <p>Take note of the editor window at the bottom of the CodeRunner window:</p>

    <p><div class="c"><img src="images/coderunner/CodeRunnerEditorWindow.png"></div></p>
    
   <p>Now, select <b>Perl</b> in the <b>Syntax</b> drop-down menu:</p>
      
   <p><div class="c"> <img src="images/coderunner/perlmode.GIF"></div></p>
      
    <p>You'll see the <img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> icon on the left side of the 
      toolbar.</p> 
      
    <p>In <b>review3.pl</b> type (don't just cut and paste!) all the code you see below so it looks like this:</p>
 
    
         
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE:</div><div class="listing"><pre>#!/usr/bin/perl

    <p>Click the <img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> icon. A <b>Results</b> window appears, showing 
      that there are no compile-time errors in the program:</p>
    
    <p><div class="c"><img src="images/coderunner/ResultsReview3.png"></div></p>
    
    <p>Click <b>Close</b> (<b>Preview</b> won't work in this version of CodeRunner).</p>
    
    <p>To run the program, open a terminal session by clicking the <b>Terminal</b> button:</p>
    
    <p><div class="c"><img src="images/coderunner/TerminalIcon.png"></div></p>
    
    <p>You're prompted for a login name and password:</p>
    
    <p><div class="c"><img src="images/coderunner/TerminalLogin.png"></div></p>
    
    <p>Enter your O'Reilly School of Technology username and password. When you enter the correct information, 
      you see a successful login and a "cold" prompt:</p>
    
    <p><div class="c"><img src="images/coderunner/TerminalSuccessfulLogin.png"></div></p>
    
    <p>Now, we'll run the program and see the results; use the Unix command <b>cd perl3</b> to change to the 
      <b>/perl3</b> folder and then type the program name preceded by <b>./</b>, as shown:</p>

    <p><div class="c"><img src="images/coderunner/RunningReview3.png"></div></p>

   <p>If you kept up with that <i>extensive</i> review, I think you're ready to tackle our first new topic!
     We'll keep it short so we don't burn you out in lesson one. We've covered a lot!</p>
  
   <p>Our new topic: <b>slices</b>. A slice is just what it sounds like; part of some kind of aggregate (like 
     an array or hash) or list. <b>Slicing</b> is a way to select a part of one of those collections:</p>
  
   <p><div class="c"><img src="images/lessonImages/slices.png"></div></p>
  
   <p>The list slice doesn't obey quite the same rules as other lists do, but we'll get to that in a minute. First let's 
     go over the syntax for a 
     slice. Because a slice is a collection of multiple things, the syntax starts with an 
     <b>@</b>:</p>
  
  <div class="c"><table class="tbl" border=""><tr><th>Slice</th><th>Form</th><th>Example</th></tr><tr><td>Array Slice</td><td>@<i>array</i>[<i>list of indices</i>]</td><td>@fruit[1,3..5]</td></tr><tr><td>Hash Slice</td><td>@<i>hash</i>{<i>list of keys</i>}</td><td>@month{'Jan', 'Mar', 'Apr'}</td></tr></table></div> 
  
   <p>The best way to get a feel for how this works is with an example. Create a new file called <b>slice.pl</b> in your 
     <b>/perl3</b> folder and type in the code below as shown:</p>
  
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE:</div><div class="listing"><pre>#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

my @chars = 'a' .. 'z';
my @indices;
push @indices, rand @chars for 1 .. shift || 10;
print $chars[$_], ', ' for @indices;
print "\n";

my @beasts = qw(cat hound frog cuckoo);
my @noises = qw(miao bay ribbit cuckoo);

my %sound;
{
  my @noises_copy = @noises;
  for my $beast ( @beasts )
  {
    $sound{$beast} = shift @noises_copy;
  }
}
print "A $_ $sound{$_}s\n" for keys %sound;

my @parts = localtime;
printf "The time is %02d:%02d:%02d\n", $parts[2], $parts[1], $parts[0];

   <p>It takes an optional argument, the number of random letters to print (the default is 10).</p>
  
   <p>(Of course, the actual letters printed will be different each time you run it.) This program prints random letters from the 
     <b>@chars</b> array. The <b>@indices</b> array consists of numbers that point to elements in the 
     <b>@chars</b>&nbsp;array. 
     It also populates a hash called <b>%sound</b>, from the contents of the <b>@beasts</b> and <b>@sounds</b> arrays. 
     (In this program we defined those arrays statically, so we could have 
     defined the hash instead, but for now just go with it as it is.)</p>

print "A $_ $sound{$_}s\n" for keys %sound;

my @parts = localtime;
<del>printf "The time is %02d:%02d:%02d\n", $parts[2], $parts[1], $parts[0];</del>

   <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it. The program <i>works</i> the same way as before, 
     but we've changed it to use a <b>@chars[ @indices ]</b> <i>array slice</i> first, then a <b>@sound{ @beasts }</b>
     <i>hash slice:</i>, and finally, a <b>@parts[2,1,0]</b> array slice.</p>
  
   <p>When you use an array slice, it is as if you had typed the list of all of the
     corresponding elements of the array at that point. In other words, typing <b>@parts[2,1,0]</b> is exactly like typing
     <b>($parts[2], $parts[1], $parts[0])</b>.</p>
    
   <p>In the case of a non-literal list of indicesâ€”for example, <b>@chars[ @indices ]</b>â€”the 
     principle is the same, but you can't identify the equivalent list until the 
     program is run.</p>
  
   <p>When you use a hash slice, it is as if you had typed the list of all of the
     corresponding elements of the hash at that point.  In other words <b>@sound{ @beasts }</b> is exactly like typing
    <b>($sound{ $beasts[0] }, $sound{ $beasts[1] }, ... $sound{ $beasts[ $#beasts ] } )</b>.</p>
  
   <p>This equivalence means that you can use <b>slices</b> in <b>lvalue</b> context just like we did with 
     <b>@sound{ @beasts }</b> in the example above.</p>
  
   <p>Now let's try out the list slice! Modify your code as shown:</p>
  
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE:</div><div class="listing"><pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

my @chars = 'a' .. 'z';
my @indices;
push @indices, rand @chars for 1 .. shift || 10;
print join( ', ' =&gt; @chars[ @indices ] ), "\n";


my @beasts = qw(cat hound frog cuckoo);
my @noises = qw(miao bay ribbit cuckoo);

my %sound;
@sound{ @beasts } = @noises;
print "A $_ $sound{$_}s\n" for keys %sound;

<del>my @parts = localtime;
printf "The time is %02d:%02d:%02d\n", @parts[2,1,0];</del>
<ins>my ($hr, $min, $sec) = (localtime)[2,1,0];
printf "The time is %02d:%02d:%02d\n", $hr, $min, $sec;</ins>
</pre></div></div>
  
   <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it. Now it's clear that we are
     extracting the hour, minute, and second components from <b>localtime</b>. (If you're unfamiliar with any of this, take a look at 
     <b>perldoc -f localtime</b>.) And we've done it with a list
     slice: the syntax doesn't use an <b>@</b> symbol, it just has a bracketed list of indices following
     a list (in parentheses). So here, <b>localtime</b> is being called in list context.</p>
  
   <p>Pop quiz!  What's the difference between <b>$array[3]</b> and <b>@array[3]</b>? Ponder for a moment...good. The 
     first one, <b>$array[3]</b>, is a <i>scalar</i>. The second one, <b>@array[3]</b>, is a <i>list</i>. It just happens to be a list of 
     one element, but it's still a list, because it's a slice, which is equivalent to a list. A lot of Perl 
     programmers get sloppy with their array notation and write a list when their intention is a scalar. 
     If you did that and enabled warnings (as you always do, right?) you'd get a warning. Usually this won't make a 
     differenceâ€”but once in a while it will. Let's create a new program called <b>bad_slice.pl</b> and see. Type the code below as shown:</p>
  
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE:</div><div class="listing"><pre>#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
# use warnings;

my @array;
$array[0] = localtime;
print "\$array[0] = $array[0]\n";
@array[0] = localtime;
print "\$array[0] = $array[0]\n";
</pre></div></div>
  
   <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it as shown:</p>
  
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>
cold:~/perl3$ <ins>./bad_slice.pl</ins>
$array[0] = Thu Sep 16 14:05:06 2010
$array[0] = 6
cold:~/perl3$
</pre></div></div>
  
   <p>What happened here? The first line displays the value of <b>localtime</b> in a 
     scalar context; the second line displays the value of <b>localtime</b> in a 
     <i>list</i> context; so the line <b>@array[0] = localtime;</b> is equivalent to the code 
     <b>($array[0]) = ( <i>seconds, minutes, hours,</i> ...)</b>.</p>
  
   <p>Now you can see that <b>$array[0]</b> will be set to the first element of that 
     listâ€”the number of secondsâ€”and every other element of the list returned by 
     <b>localtime</b> will be ignored! </p>
  
   <p>Okay, now uncomment the <b>use warnings</b> line. Rerun the program and you'll get output like 
     this:</p>
  
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE:</div><div class="observe"><pre>
Scalar value @array[0] better written as $array[0] at ./perl3/bad_slice.pl line 8.
$array[0] = Thu Sep 16 14:07:52 2010
$array[0] = 52
</pre></div></div>
  
   <p>That's just one reason we always put <b>use warnings</b> in our code.</p>
  
   <p>Most Perl programmers don't know about the hash slice. They're missing out! But not you.</p>
  
   <p>And one more thingâ€”don't confuse a <i>slice</i> with the built-in function <i>splice</i>. 
     They may sound similar, but that's about all they have in common. </p>
   
   <p>Alright then, you're off and running! See you in the next lesson!</p>
