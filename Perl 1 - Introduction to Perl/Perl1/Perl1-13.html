     <p>In this lesson you'll learn the basic functions used to write programs in Unix. After all, you won't 
         always create programs in the CodeRunner editor; you'll want to create and manipulate your files in 
         the real world.</p>
        
  <a name="s_01"></a><div id="s_01"><div class="subheading">Listing Files</div><div class="subheadingText">
            
      <p>Let's get right to it! Click the <b>New Terminal</b> button so you see the Unix prompt: <b>cold:~$</b></p>   
            
      <p>Your shell contains all the files that you've saved to your OST account. To see a list of those 
          files, use the <b>ls</b> command. Most Unix commands have very short names. At first the command 
          names may not make much sense to you, but they do have meaning. In this case, <b>ls</b> stands 
          for <b>l</b>ist <b>s</b>tuff. (At least that's how I remember it! Some people say it's just a 
          shortened version of <b>l</b>i<b>s</b>t.)</p>
      
      <p>Let's try using the <b>ls</b> command. Type at the Unix command line as shown (do NOT change directories this time!):</p>
            
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE TERMINAL SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~$ <ins>ls</ins>
Objective1.txt           cgi/                 index.html               perl1
cold:~$                                                       
</pre></div></div>
            
      <p>You'll probably see a different list, but even if you've never saved anything to your account, you'll have an 
          index.html file and a cgi directory. These were created automatically when you signed up with OST. If you've had your 
          account for a while (and you have) and taken other courses, you probably have quite a few files stored there.</p>
            
            <p>Some of the "stuff" listed will have a forward slash (<b>/</b>) following the name (for example, 
                <b>cgi/</b>). That forward slash tells you it's a directory. Directories provide a way to 
                organize your files. A directory is structured kind of like a tree. </p>
            
            <p>The root directory (indicated by the forward slash <b>/</b>) is the base of the tree. Directories within 
                the root directory are branches, and they in turn may have branches within them, which may have 
                branches within them; you can create subdirectories infinitely, and you can store files in the 
                root directory or in any subdirectory.</p>
            
            <p><div class="c"><img src="images/directory.jpg"></div></p>
            
            <p>To navigate through the tree structure, you'll use the <b>cd</b> command. This stands for 
                <b>c</b>hange <b>d</b>irectory. The <b>cd</b> command must be followed by the name of the destination 
                directory. </p>
            
            <p>Try changing to the cgi directory and listing the files there. Type at the Unix command line as shown:</p>
            
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE TERMINAL SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~$ <ins>cd cgi</ins>
cold:~/cgi$ <ins>ls</ins>
ajaxlib.pl*  cgi-lib.pl*  counter.pl*  guest.pl*
cold:~/cgi$ 
</pre></div></div>
            
            <p>You got a list that shows all the files in your cgi directory. 
            The command prompt changes to <b>cold:~/cgi$</b>. This means you're working in the 
                cgi directory. If you want to get back to your home directory from here, specify <b>..</b> as 
                your destination directory. <b>..</b> indicates that you want to go back up just one directory.</p>
                
            <p>Now go do some exploring!  Keep in mind that you can be transported back to your home 
                directory instantly from any location by typing <b>cd</b> with no destination directory.</p>
            </div></div>
            <a name="s_02"></a><div id="s_02"><div class="subheading">Wild Cards</div><div class="subheadingText">
                
                <p>If you have hundreds of files in your directory, the <b>ls</b> command could return many more 
                    files than you care to see. You can use <i>wild cards</i> to limit the amount of 
                    information displayed.</p>
                
                <p>Make sure you are in the <b>cgi</b> directory, then type at the Unix 
                command line as shown:</p>
                
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE TERMINAL SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~/cgi$ <ins>ls c*</ins>

</pre></div></div>
                
                <p>Only the files with names that begin with the letter <b>c</b> are listed.
                    The asterisk (<b>*</b>) represents the wildcard used to take the place of any number of 
                    characters.</p>
                
                <p><div class="c"><table class="noteBox fBox pBox "><tr><td class="noteTitle">Note</td><td class="note"> Keep in mind that Unix is case-sensitive; it can distinguish between 
                    upper and lowercase letters.</td></tr></table></div></p>
            
            </div></div>
            
        <a name="s_03"></a><div id="s_03"><div class="subheading">Directories</div><div class="subheadingText">
            
            <p>Create a new directory within your /perl1 directory and name it <b>stuff</b>. You can do that using the 
                <b>mkdir</b>, or <i>make directory</i>, command. Type at the Unix command line as shown:</p>
            
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE TERMINAL SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~/cgi$ <ins>cd ../perl1</ins>
cold:~/perl1$ <ins>mkdir stuff</ins>
cold:~/perl1$
</pre></div></div>
            
            <p>Now if you list your files, you can see the new directory. Type at the Unix command line as shown:</p>
            
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE TERMINAL SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~/perl1$ <ins>ls</ins>
(you'll see all the programs we've created, with your new <b>stuff/</b> folder appearing in alphabetical order in the list.)
</pre></div></div>
            
            <p>Now, move into the new directory by using the 
                <i>change directory</i> command, <b>cd</b>. Type at the Unix command line as shown:</p>
            
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE TERMINAL SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~/perl1$ <ins>cd stuff</ins>
cold:~/perl1/stuff$
</pre></div></div>
            
            <p>List the files in the new directory, using the <b>-a</b> flag with the <b>ls</b> command.
               A <i>flag</i> is an additional parameter given to a command. 
               The <b>-a</b> flag is used to display <b>a</b>ll files
                in a directory. Type at the Unix command line as shown:</p>
            
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE TERMINAL SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~/perl1/stuff$ <ins>ls -a</ins>
./   ../
cold:~/perl1/stuff$ 
</pre></div></div>
            
            <p>What?! How can there already be two files in a new directory? And what's with the names? Weird.</p>
            
            <p>Well, those "files" are actually directories that are part of the Unix file structure. The single dot represents  
                the current directory, and the double dots represent the previous, or "parent" directory. This  
                allows you to use the <b>cd ..</b> command to back "up" to that directory. Type at the Unix 
                command line as shown:</p>
            
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE TERMINAL SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~/perl1/stuff$  <ins>cd ..</ins>
cold:~/perl1$
</pre></div></div>
            
        </div></div>
        <a name="s_04"></a><div id="s_04"><div class="subheading">Copying and Removing Files</div><div class="subheadingText">
            
            <p>To copy and remove files, use the <b>cp</b> and <b>rm</b> commands, respectively. Type 
                at the Unix command line as shown:</p>
            
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE TERMINAL SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~/perl1$ <ins>cp /etc/issue .</ins>
cold:~/perl1$
</pre></div></div>
            
            <p>This means "copy the file named <b>issue</b> from the <b>/etc</b> directory into the current 
                directory (<b>.</b>)." Now type at the Unix command line as shown:</p>
            
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE TERMINAL SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~/perl1$ <ins>ls</ins>
issue  stuff/
cold:~/perl1$
</pre></div></div>
            
            <p>Again, you'll see the whole list of files you've created in these lessons, and at least the <b>issue</b> file and the 
                <b>stuff/</b> folder.</p>            
            
            <p>Excellent. But you don't really need that file, so let's remove it. Type at the Unix 
                command line as shown:</p>
            
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE TERMINAL SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~/perl1$ <ins>rm issue</ins>

 <a name="h_02"></a><div class="heading">Using a Text Editor</div><div class="headingText">
        
        <p>So far in the course, we've used the CodeRunner editor to create files. In the real 
            world, we have the option of using any of a number different editors—use 
            whichever one you like best. On a Linux-based
            operating system, you'll usually have access to the Emacs editor.</p>
        
  <a name="s_01"></a><div id="s_01"><div class="subheading">Command Keys and the Emacs Window</div><div class="subheadingText">
                
      <p>There are various command key sequences in emacs that we use to manipulate, save, search, and exit files. Here are 
          the basic key command sequence elements explained:</p>
      
      <table class="tbl"><tr><td width="5%"><span class="darkblue">C-g</span></td><td width="95%"><span class="darkblue">C</span> represents the Ctrl key. <span class="darkblue">g</span> represents the G key. The 
                  dash (<span class="darkblue">-</span>) between the C and G signifies that you should press both keys at the 
                  same time.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="darkblue">M-x</span></td><td><span class="darkblue">M</span> represents the META key. But newer computers no longer have a META key, so when you
                  see <span class="darkblue">M</span>, press the Esc key instead. Then press the X key. In some instances, you 
                  need to press the Esc key <i>twice</i> and then press the X key to execute the META function. This may sound 
                  confusing now, but you'll get the hang of it.</td></tr></table>
                
                <p>Emacs is usually accessed from the Unix command line by typing <b>emacs</b>,
            followed by the name of a file. Type at the Unix command line as shown:</p>
                
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE TERMINAL SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~/perl1$ <ins>emacs myfile.pl</ins>
cold:~/perl1$
</pre></div></div>
                <p>You'll see a screen that looks something like this:</p>
                
                <div class="c">
                    <img src="images/emacs.gif" width="481" height="315">
                </div><br>
                
                
           <p>There's a top heading highlighted in black, then a blank area in the middle, where you'll type.  
               At the bottom there's a line highlighted in black, and then a white line below that.</p>
                
               <p>The black line at the bottom
                tells you just about everything you'd ever want to know about the
                current editing environment.  You'll see the name of the
                file currently being edited (<b>myfile.pl</b>). Information about the type of file
                you're editing is located within the  
                parentheses. In this case you are editing a basic text file, so the parentheses contain the word <b>Text</b>.
                The <b>L1</b> indicates that your cursor is currently on <b>line 1</b> of
                the document.  The last bit of information indicates what portion of the file
                is on your screen.  Right now, it says <b>All</b> because
                you have the entire thing on your screen.  Often, it will be a
                percentage of the document or <b>Bot</b> if you happen to be at the end or bottom of your document.</p>
                
                   The last line in white is the command line.  Whenever you use command
                keys, they will be displayed there.  When you complete a command
                (such as saving), it will show up there as well.
                <p></p>
                <p>Type something into the document so you can practice saving and 
                exiting the file. (Emacs
                    will not let you save an empty file):</p>
                <div class="c">

                    Because you're using a telnet applet to connect to the server, it does not replicate the emacs program perfectly. 
                    After typing text into your document, try using the right and left arrow keys to move back and forth along the text. 
                    Depending on the browser and operating system you're using, you may find that some of the characters disappear. If 
                    this happens, type <b>C-l</b> and your text will reappear. If you have any questions about this, please email your 
                    mentor.
                </td></tr></table></div><br>
               <p>Now save <b>myfile.pl</b>. Type <b>C-x</b> and then <b>C-s</b>
                to save the file.  If you make a mistake you can type <b>C-g</b>
                to start over.  When you're done, you'll see
                a message that the file was written in the emacs command
            line.</p>
                <div class="c">
                    <img src="images/emacs3.gif" width="481" height="314">
                </div><br>
                Exit emacs by typing <b>C-x C-c</b>.  You'll see
                a Unix command prompt.  Use <b>ls</b> to
            find out if the file is in your account now. Type at the Unix command line as shown:
                
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE TERMINAL SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>
cold:~/perl1$ <ins>ls myfile.pl</ins>

</pre></div></div>
                
            
            <p>Once you're sure that the file has been created, you can run it. Type at the Unix command line:</p>
            
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE TERMINAL SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~/perl1$ <ins>./myfile.pl</ins>
-bash: ./myfile.pl: Permission denied
cold:~/perl1$                
</pre></div></div>
            
            <p>Hey wait—why doesn't this work?  Well, by default, files created in emacs are not created with 
                permission to execute the files. We can fix this though. Type at the Unix command line as shown:</p>
            
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE TERMINAL SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~/perl1$ <ins>chmod 755 ./myfile.pl</ins>
cold:~/perl1$                
</pre></div></div>
            
            <p>You're able to run your script now.</p>
            
            <p>Keep in mind that emacs provides many commands for editing files. For more information, check out the built-in <b>Emacs 
                help</b> (by pressing <b>F10</b> and then <b>h</b>) or do a Google search on 
                <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=emacs%20commands" target="_blank">emacs commands</a>.</p>
