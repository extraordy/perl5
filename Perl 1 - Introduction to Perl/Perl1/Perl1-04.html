   <p><div class="c"><img src="images/string.jpg"></div></p>
   
   
   <p>We refer to chunks of text as <i>strings</i> because they consist of characters <i>strung</i> together. We've been 
    using strings to print text. We can also assign them to variables, like this:</p>
   
   <p><span class="code">my $title = "Teacher";</span></p>
    
   <p>A <i>double-quoted string</i> wraps its contents between—believe it or not—double quotation marks. You 
    can put anything you want between them, and your code will mean exactly what it says, with a few 
    exceptions, like:</p>
   
   <ul><li>The sequence <b>\n</b> means "line break here"; </li><li>The sequence <b>\t</b> means "move to next tab stop here"; </li></ul>
   
   <p>Those two-character sequences—<i>digraphs</i> if you prefer the technical term—are called <i>escape 
    sequences</i> in Perl (because the backslash character changes the meaning of the next character, 
    thereby "escaping" it). If you want to include the actual backslash character itself, use 
    <i>two backslashes: <b>\\</b>.</i></p>
   
   <p>Perl doesn't move the cursor to the next line or tab stop. Instead, Perl turns the escape 
    sequences into <i>control characters</i>—special characters that are invisible—and stores 
    those in the string. When something prints the string to a screen, the driver that 
    decides where to put characters on the screen recognizes those control characters and interprets them 
    in terms of cursor movement. According to convention, there are notional "tab stops" spaced 
    every eight characters along a line; that convention is coded within the driver for the output 
    device itself. So if you're printing a string on a printer, the escape sequence <b>\f</b> gets 
    turned by Perl into the control character called form-feed, and the printer will produce a new 
    page.</p>
   
   <p>Some escape sequences don't get turned into control characters, but instead cause 
    Perl to change what follows them:</p>
   
   <ul><li><b>\l</b>: lowercase next character</li><li><b>\L</b>: lowercase all characters until end of string or the sequence <b>\E</b></li><li><b>\u</b>: uppercase next character</li><li><b>\U</b>: uppercase all characters until end of string or the sequence <b>\E</b></li></ul>
  
   <p>Hmm. That seems a little weird; after all, if you want the next character to be uppercase, why not type 
    it that way? We'll learn the answer to that question shortly.</p>
   
   <p>There are a few other escape sequences of diminishing usefulness; see <b>perldoc perlop</b> or 
    <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/perlop.html" target="_blank">http://perldoc.perl.org/perlop.html</a>, "Quote and Quote-like Operators."</p>
   
   <p>But double-quoted strings are capable of much more. You can put a scalar 
    variable inside one, and the value of the variable will be substituted—in Perl we say 
    <i>interpolated</i>—at that point.</p>
   
   <p>Let's see what that looks like. Create a new file named <b>insect_sales.pl</b> and type the code below 
    as shown:</p>
   
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE:</div><div class="listing"><pre><ins>#!/usr/bin/perl

Welcome to Echidna Eric's Insect Emporium

This is the inventory stock report for Thu Dec  3 14:55:14 2009
---------------------------------------------------------
We have 47000 ants
We have 240000 fleas
We have 520 beetles
We have 1500000 fruit flies    
cold:~/perl1$ 
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p>Perl knows the current date and time! That's a feature of the 
    <span class="darkgreen">localtime()</span> function—assign its result to a scalar and you get that handy 
    string.</p>
    
   <p>We added underscores to large numbers to make them more readable—the underscores
    are where commas (or in Europe, the decimal points) would be if I was typing the numbers for 
    publication, like <b>12,345</b>. We can't use commas or periods here, because they mean something 
    else in Perl, so we use underscores instead.</p> 
    
   <p>Every variable inside a double-quoted string is replaced by 
    its current value at run-time. This <i>interpolation</i> makes <span class="darkblue">print</span> 
    statements more readable. Compare these two statements:</p>
    
   <div class="c"><p><b>print "Name:\t", $name, ", phone:\t", $phone, "\n";</b></p>
   
   <p>or</p>
   
    <p><b>print "Name:\t$name, phone:\t$phone\n";</b></p></div>
   <br>
   <p>A few things about the sample code above might bother you. If you typed the code in by 
    hand, you probably got tired of all those <span class="darkgreen">print</span> statements. Any time you 
    spot repetition in a program, that's a sign that there's probably a better way to do 
    it. How could we collapse all of those <span class="darkgreen">print</span> statements down to one?</p>
    
   <p>We could run all the strings together, but the program would become far less <i>readable</i>:</p>
    
   <p><div class="c"><b>print "Welcome to Echidna Eric's Insect Emporium\n\nThis is the inventory stock report for 
    $date\n";</b></div></p> 
    
    
   <p>This is where Perl's <i>here documents</i> come in handy. (We call them <i>heredocs</i> for short.) 
    What we'd really like to write in the code is the text to be printed out, the way we
    want it to come out; heredocs let us do this. 
    Edit the program as shown:

   <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it. </p>
   
    <p>Running the program gives the same result, but it's much more readable now. Here's  
    how it works: <span class="darkblue">&lt;&lt;</span>, followed by a string within double quotation marks (in this case, 
     <span class="darkblue">END_OF_REPORT</span>), is a Perl expression. That expression's value is the string that starts on the next 
    line and continues up until (but not including) a line consisting of <i>precisely</i> the same string 
     that followed <span class="darkblue">&lt;&lt;</span>. You must then have a newline character and nothing else.
    That includes trailing spaces, so make sure you don't have any! If you 
    do, or if you make some other mistake in the terminating line, Perl will run off the end of your
    program searching for it and then complain. Let's make that mistake deliberately so you know 
    what the error looks like. Edit your code as shown:</p>

    <p>The string behaves like a <i>double-quoted</i> string, so you can interpolate variables in it.</p>

     report with one <span class="darkblue">print</span> statement and one set of double quotes around

     in the report without realizing it, the quote would have to 
     be escaped. It's also harder to see where a multi-line string ends without a distinctive line, 
     like the one heredocs supplies.</td></tr></table></p>

    <p>Hmmm. It doesn't work. There is no variable named 
     <span class="darkred">$insect_of_the_months</span>. We meant to print 
     out the value of <span class="darkred">$insect_of_the_month</span> followed by an 's'. But Perl doesn't know 
     that-it just reads as many consecutive characters in a variable name as it can, while still 
     following the rules, and used that result. To get the result we want, 
     we need some syntax in Perl that indicates, "this is the end of a variable name." 
     For that, we'll use braces {}. Edit <b>insect_sales.pl</b> as shown:</p>

    <p>So now you've seen how variables 
     can be interpolated inside double-quoted strings; how do you 
     think the <b>\l</b> and <b>\U</b> escape sequences are useful? Think it over before reading 
     the next section.</p>
   
  </div></div>
  <a name="s_02"></a><div id="s_02"><div class="subheading">Single-Quoted Strings</div><div class="subheadingText">
   
   <p><div class="c">Quotation, n.: The act of repeating erroneously the words of another. The words 
    erroneously repeated. - Ambrose Bierce, The Devil's Dictionary</div></p>
   
   <p>Let's say you want an actual, uninterpolated, plain 
    dollar sign <b>$</b> in a double-quoted string. You'd escape it in the usual way: <b>"I have \$10 in my wallet"</b>. And 
    suppose you want a lot of plain dollar signs and backslash characters that remain as such. 
    You could accomplish this by escaping each one, but you're going to get tired of hitting the 
    backslash key, not to mention reading that long string!</p>
   
   <p>You might think that this type of situation doesn't come up very often, outside of financial
    reports, but there's one example of strings like that you're certain to encounter: Perl code itself. 
    We're not ready to tackle Perl code embedded as strings in 
    Perl programs just yet, but trust me, they do occur, and when they do, you'll be glad you 
    learned about <i>single-quoted</i> strings.</p>
   
   <p>A single-quoted string is surrounded by single quotation marks and obeys
    these basic rules:</p>
   
   <ul><li>A backslash followed by single quote (<b>\'</b>) means single quote (<b>'</b>)</li><li>A backslash followed by backslash (<b>\\</b>) means backslash (<b>\</b>)</li></ul>
   
   <p>That's it. Everything else comes out just the way you put it in—including any backslashes 
    that aren't followed by a single quotation mark or a backslash. Heredocs 
    follow the same rules—use a single quotation mark after the <b>&lt;&lt;</b> instead of double quotation marks.  
    In that case, <i>everything</i> inside the heredoc is taken literally, including all backslashes 
    and single quotation marks. This can be especially useful when you want to print a chunk of text 
    completely literally—with no interpolation of any kind—and you don't want to escape dollar 
    signs or check for other things that can be interpolated.</p> 
    
    <p>Take a look at this code:</p>
   
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE:</div><div class="observe"><pre>#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

my $mail_message = &lt;&lt;'END_OF_TEXT';
From: Dutiful Developer &lt;programmer@example.com&gt;
To: Masterful Manager &lt;boss@example.com&gt;
Subject: Code finished

Hi boss, I finished my program.  I'm especially proud of this part:

  my $first_name = "creative";
  my $last_name = "Ceo";
  print "This program ($0) is dedicated to our dear leader, \L\u$first_name \U$last_name\n";
END_OF_TEXT

</pre></div></div>
   
   <p>There's some interesting stuff embedded 
    in the code written by Dutiful Developer that I haven't told you about yet. Take the code 
    fragment that's quoted in the mail message in the program (we have a program within a string 
    within a program...), put it in a new file called <b>escape_test.pl</b>, and <i>add the necessary 
    preamble for all programs</i>, as shown:</p>  
    
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE:</div><div class="listing"><pre><ins>#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

my $first_name = "creative";
my $last_name = "Ceo";
print "This program ($0) is dedicated to our dear leader, \L\u$first_name \U$last_name\n";</ins>
</pre></div></div>
    
    <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it. </p>
    
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE TERMINAL SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~/perl1$ <ins>./escape_test.pl</ins>
This program (./escape_test.pl) is dedicated to our dear leader, Creative CEO    
cold:~/perl1$ 
</pre></div></div>
    
    <p>There's a detailed explanation of what's happening in this code
    here: <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/perlvar.html" target="_blank">http://perldoc.perl.org/perlvar.html</a>; look for "PROGRAM_NAME." Take note of the  
    effect of <b>\L\u</b>. Do you see why Perl's creator would want it to work this way?</p>
   
   <p>Also, our code has one of Perl's <i>special variables</i>—<span class="darkred">$0</span>. It's not a 
    variable <i>you</i> can declare—it doesn't comply with the naming rules we know.
    But it's one of a number of variables that Perl populates with certain values. <span class="darkred">$0</span> 
    contains the name of the program being executed (including whatever path was specified in the 
    command line invocation).</p>
  
  </div></div>
  <a name="s_03"></a><div id="s_03"><div class="subheading">Interpolate Now Or Later?</div><div class="subheadingText">
   
   <p><div class="c">"Believe me, you have to get up early if you want to get out of bed" <br> 
    -Groucho Marx</div></p>
   
   <p>Modify <span class="darkred">escape_test.pl</span> as follows: </p>
     
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO EDIT:</div><div class="listing"><pre>#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

my $first_name = "creative";
my $last_name = "Ceo";
   <ins>  
my $dedication = "This program ($0) is dedicated to our dear leader, \L\u$first_name \U$last_name\n";
$first_name = 'passionate';
$last_name = 'president';
print $dedication;</ins>
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and save it—but <i>before you run 
    it</i>—quick, 
    what do you think it will do?  Will the dedication be to "Creative CEO" or "Passionate President"? 
    <i>Why</i> do you think that?</p>
   
   <p>Now run the program. You can see from the result that Perl does what we call <i>early 
    binding</i> of variable values. That is, when <span class="darkred">$dedication</span> is assigned, the 
    variables that are part of the expression assigned to it are evaluated to their values <i>in that instant</i>. 
    Changing those variables later makes <i>no difference</i> to the value of 
    <span class="darkred">$dedication</span>, because it's already been formed.</p>
   
   <p>(And thank goodness it works this way, too; otherwise Perl programming would become seriously difficult. 
   Think about it.)</p>
  
  </div></div>
  
  <p>Wow. We're really making progress. Keep it up! See you in the next lesson!</p>
