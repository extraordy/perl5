 <p>Welcome to the final lesson in your Introduction to Perl course! This last lesson involves learning
 how to read information from files outside of your program. 
 </p>
 <a name="h_01"></a><div class="heading">Input with Perl's &lt;&gt; Operator</div><div class="headingText">
   
  <p>Command line programs, in particular the "filtering" set of programs that are in 
   the Unix/Linux utility set (<b>grep, sed, awk, head, tail, cut, sort</b> and, yes, even
   <b>cat</b>) all have a common "interface." You invoke each of these programs using 
   a command line call that looks like this:</p>
   
  <p><div class="c"><b><i>program</i> <i>options</i> <i>file(s)</i></b></div></p>
   
  <p>In our command line, <i><b>program</b></i> would be a member of our filtering set, such as <b>awk</b> or <b>sed</b>.  
  Then <i><b>options</b></i> 
  (if there are options present)
   would consist of a set of options, each beginning with a minus sign (<b>-</b>). 
   Then <i><b>file(s)</b></i> would be one or more filenames, which would then be read in 
   succession by <i><b>program</b></i>, and processed.</p> 
  
  <p>If no files are specified, the <i><b>program</b></i>
   reads its input from standard input (<i>program</i> is usually called as part of a command
   pipeline set up with the vertical bar (<b>|</b>) symbol between programs).  Standard input
   may also be read at a specific point if a filename argument is the minus sign by itself.
   Take a look at a few samples to familiarize yourself with this style of program invocation:</p>
   
  <ul><li>cat amphibians.txt rodents.txt &gt; mammals.txt</li><li>head -100 wind_in_the_willows | sed -e 's/toad/hedgehog/g' &gt; plagiarized_story</li><li>tail -f error_log | grep -vi php</li><li>generate_orders -month 10 | sort -nr orders_sep - orders_nov &gt; orders_fall</li></ul>
   
  <p> 
    Here's a skeleton for a program in Perl using those same calling conventions:</p>
   
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: </div><div class="observe"><pre>
<span class="darkblue">#!/usr/bin/perl</span>
<span class="purple">use strict;
use warnings;</span>

# Shift off any arguments in @ARGV that begin with minus signs, and any values they take
<span class="purple">while</span> ( <span class="darkgreen">defined</span>( <span class="purple">my</span> <span class="darkred">$line</span> = &lt;&gt; ) )
{
  # Process a line of input, which is now in $line
}
</pre></div></div>
   
  <p>This skeleton provides <i>all</i> of the functionality we talked about, 
   <i>including</i> processing multiple files, and processing standard input. 
   And all that functionality is implemented by 
   just two characters: <b>&lt;&gt;</b>.  (They are called the "diamond operator" because of the shape formed by putting the characters together.)</p>
   
  <p>We'd better take a closer look at those two characters! Even though at first glance you might think so, 
  they don't have anything to do with less than or greater than tests. 
   In fact, this pair of characters together comprise a special operator in Perl—and that operator 
   does a <i>lot</i>. We'll begin to 
   see just how much, in this example.  Create <b>store_report.pl</b> as shown:</p>
   
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE:</div><div class="listing"><pre><ins>#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

my (%item_cost, %inventory);
while ( defined( my $line = &lt;&gt; ) )
{
  my ($cost, $quantity, $item) = split " ", $line, 3;
  $item_cost{$item} = $cost;
  $inventory{$item} = $quantity;
}

my %sold = ('White Peaches' =&gt; 12, 'Rainier Cherries' =&gt; 20,
             Durien         =&gt; -1, 'Spartan Apples'   =&gt; 24);  # One durien returned... too smelly

foreach my $item ( keys %sold )
{
  if ( exists $inventory{$item} )
  {
    $inventory{$item} -= $sold{$item};
  }
  else
  {
    warn "*** Sold $sold{$item} of $item, which were not in inventory\n";
  }
}

foreach my $item ( sort keys %item_cost )
{
  printf "%5.2f %6d %s\n", $item_cost{$item}, $inventory{$item}, $item;
}
</ins></pre></div></div>
   
  <table class="noteBox pBox "><tr><td class="noteTitle">Note</td><td class="note">Keep in mind that this program is not the same version you used in your homework that accepted sales figures 
   from the command line; we're going to use that command line here for passing the store 
   inventory filename.</td></tr></table>
    
  <p>Now, create an input file named <b>store_report.input</b> in the same folder:</p>
 
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">TEXT TO TYPE:</div><div class="listing"><pre><ins> 0.95   300   White Peaches

 1.50   400   Cherry Tomatoes
</ins></pre></div></div>
   
  <p>Save both of your files, and then <img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run

  <p>It <i>doesn't work</i>. (It runs, but doesn't produce the same output as the 
   last version of this program.) Can you see why? What's odd about the inventory that it 
   prints out?</p>
   
  <p>The inventory output has a blank line between each line of output. What does
   that suggest? <i>That each item in the inventory—the last thing printed on each 
   line—contains a newline character at the end of it.</i> That explains why none of the sold 
   items were found in the inventory: the sales loop was looking in <span class="darkred">%inventory</span> for a 
   key of, for instance, <span class="orange">"Durien"</span>, but that key wasn't there. Instead, there was 
   an element with a key of <span class="orange">"Durien<b>\n</b>"</span>  
   in <span class="darkred">%inventory</span>.</p>
   
  <a name="s_01"></a><div id="s_01"><div class="subheading">chomp()</div><div class="subheadingText">
   
   <p>When <b>&lt;&gt;</b> reads in a line, it leaves the <span class="darkblue">\n</span>
    at the end of the line. The previous version of this program used 
    <span class="darkgreen">split</span> <span class="orange">"\n"</span>, <span class="darkred">$lines</span>. The 
    result didn't contain any <span class="darkblue">\n</span> characters, because the 
    <span class="darkgreen">split</span> function returned everything <i>between</i> the
    <span class="darkblue">\n</span> characters.</p> 
   
   <p>The built-in function <span class="darkgreen">chomp()</span> takes one argument, a scalar, and 
    if a <span class="darkblue">\n</span> character is present at the end of the scalar, 
    that <span class="darkblue">\n</span> character is removed. If the scalar doesn't end with a 
    <span class="darkblue">\n</span>, then <span class="darkgreen">chomp()</span> has no effect. Here's how you'll

   <p>Your results are the same as when you ran a version of this program
    in the previous lesson.</p>
   

   
   <p>
    Now let's see the "default to standard input" behavior of <b>&lt;&gt;</b>.  Run the same program again <i>without any arguments.</i>
    Nothing will happen.  Perl is waiting for input on STDIN, which is by default set to your terminal.  Copy and paste some of the lines from
    <b>store_report.input</b> (or copy them from the display below, or make up your own new input).  Then type <b>Ctrl-D</b> <i>at the beginning of the next line</i>.
    That is how you tell the Unix shell that
    there is no more input on STDIN, and that causes Perl to see an end of file on input.  You will not get your prompt back until you
    type <b>Ctrl-D</b> on a line by itself!  I've shown it as <b>^D</b> below:
   </p>
   
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~/perl1$ <ins>./store_report.pl
 0.95   300   White Peaches
 1.45   120   California Avocados
10.50    10   Durien
^D   </ins>
*** Sold 20 of Rainier Cherries, which were not in inventory
*** Sold 24 of Spartan Apples, which were not in inventory
1.45    120 California Avocados
10.50     11 Durien
0.95    288 White Peaches   
cold:~/perl1$    
</pre></div></div> 
   
   <p>
    You don't have to supply input to STDIN by typing it like this, though.  You can use the redirection operators of the Unix
    shell to supply it from another program, for instance.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Now that you have a working example of <b>&lt;&gt;</b>, we'll go over its behavior in 
    detail. </p>
  
  </div></div>   
  <a name="s_02"></a><div id="s_02"><div class="subheading">Operation of &lt;&gt; in Scalar Context</div><div class="subheadingText">
   
   <p>When you call <b>&lt;&gt;</b> for the <i>first</i> time, it examines <span class="darkred">@ARGV</span>. 
   </p>
   <p> If there are no elements in <span class="darkred">@ARGV</span>, then <b>&lt;&gt;</b> operates on 
    standard input. </p>
    <p>If there is an element in <span class="darkred">@ARGV</span>, Perl removes that element from 
    <span class="darkred">@ARGV</span> (Perl actually modifies the <span class="darkred">@ARGV</span> array from within the 
     <b>&lt;&gt;</b> operator). </p><p>Then Perl opens the file named by that element. (If the file 
    cannot be opened, Perl prints a warning to the standard error stream and goes on to the 
      next element of <span class="darkred">@ARGV</span>.) </p><p>If the file name is the minus sign (<b>-</b>), Perl opens standard 
    input.</p>
   
   <p>Now that Perl has an input file open, it returns the first line of that file. That's the 
    (scalar context) result of <b>&lt;&gt;</b>.</p>
   
   <p>The <i>next</i> time that <b>&lt;&gt;</b> is called, it returns the <i>next</i> line from
    the input, and so on.</p>
   
   <p>When there are no more lines in the input, <b>&lt;&gt;</b> returns the undefined 
    value.</p>
  
  </div></div>
  <a name="s_03"></a><div id="s_03"><div class="subheading">Operation of &lt;&gt; in List Context</div><div class="subheadingText">
   
   <p>In list context, <b>&lt;&gt;</b> returns all remaining lines from all remaining files 
    named in <span class="darkred">@ARGV</span>.</p>
   
   <p>When <b>&lt;&gt;</b> has finished (returns <span class="orange">undef</span> in scalar context or 
    has finished executing in list context), <span class="darkred">@ARGV</span> will be empty.</p>
  
  </div></div>  
 </div>
 <a name="h_02"></a><div class="heading">Going Further with the Example</div><div class="headingText">
    
  <p>Now let's alter <b>store_report.pl</b> so it will read the sales report from a file
   as well. Modify <span class="darkred">@ARGV</span> <i>yourself</i> so it contains 
   just the filename(s) you need at each point. (Even though <span class="darkred">@ARGV</span> is a special 
   variable set by Perl, we're still allowed to change it!) Edit <b>store_report.pl</b> as shown:</p>
    
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE:</div><div class="listing"><pre>#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

<ins>my %sold;
if ( @ARGV &gt; 2 &amp;&amp; shift eq "-s" )
{
  my $sales_file = shift;
  my @saved_argv = @ARGV;
  @ARGV = $sales_file;
  while ( defined( my $line = &lt;&gt; ) )
  {
    chomp $line;
    my ($quantity, $item) = split " ", $line, 2;
    $sold{$item} = $quantity;
  }
  @ARGV = @saved_argv;
}
else
{

my (%item_cost, %inventory);
while ( defined( my $line = &lt;&gt; ) )
{
  chomp $line;
  my ($cost, $quantity, $item) = split " ", $line, 3;
  $item_cost{$item} = $cost;
  $inventory{$item} = $quantity;
}

<del>my %sold = ('White Peaches' =&gt; 12, 'Rainier Cherries' =&gt; 20,
             Durien         =&gt; -1, 'Spartan Apples'   =&gt; 24);  # One durien returned... too smelly</del>

foreach my $item ( keys %sold )

    $inventory{$item} -= $sold{$item};
  }

    warn "*** Sold $sold{$item} of $item, which were not in inventory\n";
  }
}

foreach my $item ( sort keys %item_cost )
{
  printf "%5.2f %6d %s\n", $item_cost{$item}, $inventory{$item}, $item;
}
</pre></div></div>
    
  <p>Now create <b>sales_report.sales</b> with the following contents:</p>
    
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">TEXT TO TYPE:</div><div class="listing"><pre><ins>12 White Peaches
20 Rainier Cherries
-1 Durien
24 Spartan Apples  
</ins></pre></div></div>
    
  <p>The program name is followed by an option, <b>-s</b>, which takes 
   an argument that is the name of a file from sales data. (Ironically, this option is not 
   optional.) Any inventory files you want to include must be named after the sales data file on the command line.</p>
    
  <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run store_report.pl as shown:</p>
  
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~/perl1$ <ins>./store_report.pl -s ./sales_report.sales ./store_report.input</ins>
*** Sold 20 of Rainier Cherries, which were not in inventory
1.45    120 California Avocados
1.50    400 Cherry Tomatoes

0.40   1476 Spartan Apples
0.95    288 White Peaches   
cold:~/perl1$    
</pre></div></div>
    
  <p>Your program's output should be the same as the output you got the last time you ran it.</p>
    
  <p>First, our program makes sure that <span class="darkred">@ARGV</span> contains enough 
   elements and that the first element is <span class="orange">"-s"</span>. Next, it <span class="darkblue">shift</span>s off the name of the
   sales file, saves the remainder of <span class="darkred">@ARGV</span>, and repopulates <span class="darkred">@ARGV</span> with 
   just the name of the sales file. Then it reads the sales file using the diamond operator, 
   which reads only the sales file because that's the only file named in <span class="darkred">@ARGV</span>. Then 
   our program restores the saved contents of <span class="darkred">@ARGV</span> and goes on with the rest of the program as 
   usual.</p>
    
  <p>In the usage message, the special variable <b>$0</b> is set by Perl to contain the name of 
   the program itself. Try calling the program with an incorrect usage to trigger the error. 
   Now try altering the items and quantities in the sales and inventory files, to see what happens.</p>
   
  <p>I should point out that this is not the most common skeleton for processing files named on the 
   command line in Perl. The more common method is outside the scope of this course, but it's covered in Perl 
   2, along with lots of other cool stuff!</p>

  <H4>We're all done here!</H4>
    
  <p>Congratulations, you did it! We're at the end of the course. Thanks for making this happen and for all of your hard work! 
  It's been great having you here. Remember to finish your final assignments, and always have fun using Perl! </p>
