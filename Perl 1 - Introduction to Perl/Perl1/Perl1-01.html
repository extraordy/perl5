 <a name="h_01"></a><div class="heading">Learning with O'Reilly School of Technology Courses</div><div class="headingText">  
  <p>As with every O'Reilly School of Technology course, we'll take a <i>user-active</i> 
    approach to learning. This means that you (the user) will be active! You'll learn by doing,  
    building live programs, testing them and experimenting with them—hands-on!</p>
  
  <p>To learn a new skill or technology, you have to experiment. The more you experiment, the more 
    you learn. Our system is designed to maximize experimentation and help you <i>learn to 
      learn</i> a new skill.</p>
  
  <p>We'll program as much as possible to be sure that the principles sink in and stay with you.</p>
  
  <p>Each time we discuss a new concept, you'll put it into code and see what YOU can do with it.  
   On occasion we'll even give you code that doesn't work, so you can see common mistakes and how 
   to recover from them. Making mistakes is actually another good way to learn.</p>  
    
  <p>Above all, we want to help you to <i>learn to learn</i>. We give you the tools to take control 
    of your own learning experience. </p>

  <p>When you complete an OST course, you know the subject matter, <i>and</i> you know how to 
    expand your knowledge, so you can handle changes like software and operating system updates.</p>
   
   <p>Here are some tips for using O'Reilly School of Technology courses effectively:</p>

  <ul><li><b>Type the code.</b> Resist the temptation to cut and paste the example code we give you. 
    Typing the code  
      actually gives you a feel for the programming task. Then play around with the examples to find out what 
      else you can make them do, and to check your understanding. It's highly
      unlikely you'll break anything by experimentation. If you <i>do</i> break something, that's an indication to us that 
      we need to improve our system!</li><li><b>Take your time.</b> Learning takes time. Rushing can have negative effects on your 
      progress. Slow down and let your brain absorb the new information thoroughly. 
      Taking your time helps to maintain a relaxed, positive approach. It also gives you the 
      chance to try new things and learn more than you otherwise would if you blew 
      through all of the coursework too quickly.</li><li><b>Experiment.</b> Wander from the path often and explore the possibilities. We can't 
      anticipate all of your questions and ideas, so it's up to you to experiment and create on 
      your own. Your instructor will help if you go completely off the rails.</li><li><b>Accept guidance, but don't depend on it.</b> Try to solve problems on your own. Going 
      from misunderstanding to understanding is the best way to acquire a new skill. Part of what 
      you're learning is problem solving. Of course, you can always contact your instructor 
      for hints when you need them.</li><li><b>Use all available resources!</b> In real-life problem-solving, you aren't bound by false 
      limitations; in OST courses, you are free to use any resources at your disposal to solve
      problems you encounter: the Internet, reference books, and online help are all fair game.   
      </li><li><b>Have fun!</b> Relax, keep practicing, and don't be afraid to make mistakes! 
      Your instructor will keep you at it until you've 
      mastered the skill. We want you to get that satisfied, "I'm so cool! I did it!"
      feeling. And you'll have some projects to show off when you're done.</li></ul>

 <a name="h_01"></a><div class="heading">Lesson Format</div><div class="headingText">
        
    <p>We'll try out lots of examples in each lesson. We'll have you write code, 
    look at code, and edit existing code. The code will be presented in boxes that will 
    indicate what needs to be done to the code inside.</p>
        
    <p>Whenever you see white boxes like the one below, you'll <i>type</i> the contents into the editor window to try the example yourself. 
      The CODE TO TYPE bar on top of the white box contains directions for you to follow:</p>
        
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE:</div><div class="listing"><pre>White boxes like this contain code for you to try out (type into a file to run).

If you have already written some of the code, new code for you to add <ins>looks like this</ins>. 
    
If we want you to remove existing code, the code to remove <del>will look like this</del>.
  
<span class="gray">We may also include instructive comments that you don't need to type.</span>  
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p>We may run programs and do some other activities in a terminal session in the operating system or other command-line environment. These will be shown 
     like this:</p>
   
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>
The plain black text that we present in these INTERACTIVE boxes is 
provided by the system (not for you to type). The commands we want you to type <ins>look like this</ins>.
</pre></div></div>   
        
  <p>Code and information presented in a gray OBSERVE box is for you to <i>inspect</i> and <i>absorb</i>. 
  This information is often color-coded, and followed by text explaining the code in detail:</p>
        
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE:</div><div class="observe"><pre>
Gray "Observe" boxes like this contain <span class="darkred">information</span> (usually code specifics) for you to <i>observe</i>.
</pre></div></div>

   <p>The paragraph(s) that follow may provide addition details on <span class="darkred">information</span> that was 
     highlighted in the Observe box.</p>
   
   <p>We'll also set especially pertinent information apart in "Note" boxes:</p>      
   
   <p><div class="c"><table class="noteBox fBox pBox "><tr><td class="noteTitle">Note</td><td class="note">Notes provide information that is useful, but not absolutely necessary for performing the tasks at hand.</td></tr></table></div> </p>

 <a name="h_01"></a><div class="heading">What is Perl?</div><div class="headingText">
     
    <p>Perl has been around for a <i>long</i> time. It was invented by Larry Wall in 
       <a href="http://history.perl.org/PerlTimeline.html" target="_blank">1987</a>. Since then, it has evolved 
     significantly and it's also been the subject of a few myths. Perl has been described as "the duct tape of 
      the internet," because of its adaptability and flexibility. When the Web was invented,  
      people everywhere used Perl to create web pages during the frenzy we now wistfully refer to as <i>the dot-com boom.</i></p> 
     <p>To give you a bit more background, here are some FAQs and answers about Perl:</p>
     
    <ul><li><b>Q:</b> Is Perl compiled or interpreted?</li><li><b>A:</b> Perl code is compiled to a kind of byte code, which is then 
         executed, but we don't keep the byte code around between executions. 
         Perl reads source really quickly, so performance isn't an issue. And Perl programs can 
         construct code to be compiled and executed at run time, so the compiler always has to be 
         available. Perl reads all of the code before running any of it, so 
         the code must be syntactically correct before its execution begins.</li><li><b>Q:</b> Is Perl fast?</li><li><b>A:</b> Hand-optimized assembly language will always be fastest, but 
        most of the time, people worry too much about performance—if your program takes 0.1 seconds 
        to run, but it could have been improved to run in 0.01 seconds, most of the time no one will 
        care. We are concerned instead with the speed of development and 
        the ease of maintenance our programs offer. Perl's built-in functions are written in hand-optimized
        C code, so quite often, a Perl program performing text manipulation will run faster than a 
        casually written C version.</li><li><b>Q:</b> Is Perl difficult to understand?</li><li><b>A:</b> As with any language, people can write code in Perl that's clear or murky. 
        Perl provides multiple ways to execute 
        the same tasks. If programmers learn Perl through copying bad examples, they'll write bad code. 
        But in this course, we'll write Perl that conforms to the best practices and write great code!</li><li><b>Q:</b> What is Perl good for?</li><li><b>A:</b> Just about everything that doesn't involve touching hardware—we don't recommend 
        writing device drivers or operating systems in Perl.
      Large enterprise-scale applications involving the work of multiple teams need to be 
      developed with discipline and a consistent methodology, because tools that enforce style and interface 
      definitions are uncommon for Perl. But large-scale applications and frameworks have 
      been developed in Perl.
       </li><li><b>Q:</b> How has Perl been used so far?</li><li><b>A:</b> Some of the most important uses of Perl are secret, because businesses view them 
        as strategic advantages. Some of the known prominent known uses of Perl include: Large 
        parts of the infrastructures of eBay, Yahoo!, and Amazon. Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, 
        Deutsche Bank and other large financial institutions make heavy use of Perl, as do 
        TicketMaster and the British Broadcasting Corporation. Perl use is especially widespread in 
        educational institutions, research agencies such as NASA, and government offices such as the 
        US Courts.</li><li><b>Q:</b> How do I get help using Perl for my project?</li><li><b>A:</b> A great triumph of the Perl community is the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network, 
        or <i>CPAN</i>. This is a repository of tens of thousands of downloadable
        <i>modules</i> written by lots of different authors, providing reusable code that 
        performs almost every conceivable task. Using CPAN modules will help you accomplish 
        any Perl task that much faster!</li></ul>

 <a name="h_02"></a><div class="heading">Getting Started</div><div class="headingText">

   <p>Before we get started with Perl, you need to be familiar with the working environment we'll be using: 
     the Unix environment. Unix allows you to write Perl programs on our computers so you don't need to worry about 
     having any special software on your own  
     computer. We have an entire OST course devoted to Unix if you'd like a deeper understanding of that operating
     system.
     For now, let's go over just the elements
     you'll need to get started learning Perl. </p>
   
 </div>

  
 <a name="h_03"></a><div class="heading">Build and Run a Perl Program</div><div class="headingText"> 
   
    <p>True to OST form, we're going to get to programming right away. Let's make sure you can run a Perl program first.</p>
    
    <p>Usually you'll 
      enter a Perl program in your favorite text editor and then run it by typing a command in a 
      command <i>shell</i> (that's the term for one of those special programs whose job in life
      is to display a prompt and then let you type in a command that causes it to run a program when 
      you press Enter). On a Unix or Linux type of system (that includes OS X), the shell is bash, 
      or tcsh, or some other -sh, and the editor is vim or Emacs or any of many other possibilities. 
      On Windows the shell is the DOS window (what you get by running "cmd") and the editor is 
      Notepad or Wordpad or vim or, again, any of many other possibilities. (You can also run 
      programs on Windows by double-clicking their icons, but then the usual input and output 
      streams are not available.)</p>
  
    <p>In this course we're going to use a completely integrated environment because we want the 
      course to be about learning Perl, not about learning a particular editor and operating 
      system. Later in the course there is a brief lesson on basic Unix commands and editors so 
      that, when you're ready, you can transfer your knowledge of Perl to the real world.</p>

   <p>Let's get started on your first program! First, we'll create a folder to keep all of our Perl stuff 
     organized. In the left panel of your CodeRunner window, right-click <b>Home</b>, and select 
     <b>New folder...</b> as shown:</p>
   
   <p><div class="c"> <img src="images/coderunner/NewFolder.gif"></div></p>
   
   <p>Name the new folder <b>perl1</b> as shown, and press <b>Enter</b>:</p>
   
   <p><div class="c"> <img src="images/coderunner/NewFolderPerl1.gif"></div></p>
   
   <p>Now, select <b>Perl</b> in the <b>Syntax</b> drop-down menu:</p>
      
   <p><div class="c"> <img src="images/coderunner/perlmode.jpg"></div></p>
      
    <p>You should now see a <img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> icon on the left side of the 
      toolbar.</p> 
      
    <p>In the editor, type (don't just cut and paste!) all the lines you see below so it looks like this:</p>

<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE:</div><div class="listing"><pre><ins>#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;
print "Hello, world!\n";</ins>
</pre></div></div>
     
   <p>Once you've typed the code, save it and check the syntax. Click the 
     <img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> button. A new window will open where you can name and 
     save the file. Select the <b>/perl1</b> folder you just created (save all your files here unless otherwise specified), 
     enter the file name <b>hello_world.pl</b>, and click <b>Save</b>:</p> 
   
   <p><div class="c"> <img src="images/coderunner/SaveHelloWorld.gif"></div></p>
      
   <p>You'll see the Results of debugging your program. If everything went 
     alright, you'll see the message <span class="darkred">hello_world.pl syntax OK</span>:</p>
   
   <p><div class="c"> <img src="images/coderunner/results.gif"></div></p>
      
   <p>Note that there are two buttons, one labeled <b>Preview</b> and one labeled <b>Close</b>.
   The Preview button can be used to view scripts that can be run in a web browser, but in this 
   course we will be writing Perl scripts that can <i>only be executed on the command line</i>.
   Go ahead and click the <b>Close</b> button, and let's learn how to do this.</p>
  
  <a name="s_01"></a><div id="s_01"><div class="subheading">Running Your Program</div><div class="subheadingText">
   <p>Now that your program is saved and the syntax checked, let's run it!</p>
    
    <p>Click the <b>New Terminal</b> button in the Toolbar: <img src="images/coderunner/newterminal.JPG">.</p>
      
     <p>Log in to the OST server.  Be sure to replace <ins>username</ins> with your username.
     It should look something like this:</p>
      
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE TERMINAL SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>
login: <ins>username</ins>
password:
Last login: Mon Aug 16 11:36:41 from 63.171.219.110
cold:~$ 
</pre></div></div>
    
    <table class="noteBox pBox "><tr><td class="noteTitle">Note</td><td class="note">When you enter your password, the cursor will not move.  In fact, it will not appear
    as though anything is happening.  Rest assured, it is.  Just be sure to type your password
    carefully and hit Enter.  If you are having trouble, please contact your mentor.</td></tr></table>
       
      <p>The server is named <b>cold</b>.  All OST students have shells on this server.  A <b>shell</b>
      is the place where you execute Unix commands on the server.  The commands you execute on your
      shell will not effect any other shell.</p>
       
      <p><b>cold:~$</b> is called a command prompt.  If you see this, you're ready to execute 
        Unix commands.  To run your program, go to the Unix prompt, and change the directory to the
        perl1 directory.  Then call the program by name:</p>
   
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE:</div><div class="listing"><pre>
cold:~$ <ins>cd perl1</ins>
cold:~/perl1$ <ins>./hello_world.pl</ins>
Hello, world!
cold:~/perl1$ 
</pre></div></div>

    <p><table class="noteBox fBox pBox "><tr><td class="noteTitle">Note</td><td class="note">We're saving all of our programs in the /perl1 folder, so we will change to that folder to run them. As a reminder, 
      we'll show the <b>cd perl1</b> command in the interactive session in each lesson.</td></tr></table></p>    
  
  </div></div>
    
   <p>Congratulations, you've run a Perl program! Sure, it's nothing fancy—it just prints out "Hello 
      World"—but we're off to a good start.</p>
   
   <p>From now on, when we want you to run a program, we'll just say 
     "<img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it," and you should follow the procedure 
     above.</p>
    
   <p>You've probably guessed what the <span class="darkgreen">print()</span> function does, but you may be
      wondering what those other lines in the program do. The short answer is that every Perl 
      program you write will begin with those lines, so don't worry about them. But we 
      figure that you're the curious type, or you wouldn't be here. So here's the real scoop:</p>

<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE:</div><div class="observe"><pre>
<ins>#!/usr/bin/perl</ins>
<span class="purple">use strict;
use warnings;</span>
</pre></div></div>
  
    <p>The first line is what we call a "shebang" line—all scripts on Unix-like computers start 
      with #! and scripts on Windows mostly ignore that line. What follows the #! characters tells 
      the operating system where to find the program that can read the rest of the file. Now you 
      know that /usr/bin/perl is where to find the specific program that runs Perl programs in this script. 
      The location may vary depending on which computer you're using.</p> 
    
    <p>The next two lines of code (in <span class="purple">purple</span>) enable optional parts of Perl called 
      <i>pragmas</i>, that tell Perl to be picky about the code we give it. The result is that Perl 
      will catch and tell us about many common programming errors that we might make.</p>
  
    <p>You will likely encounter Perl programs written by other people who have neglected to include those 
      lines at the beginning. We are not going to be like those programmers. 
      This course uses <i>best practices</i> in Perl programming, and using those 
      lines is one of them. </p>
    
    <p><div class="c"><table class="noteBox fBox pBox "><tr><td class="noteTitle">Note</td><td class="note">An older alternative to "use warnings" is to include a " -w" at the end of the shebang line;
      if you see that, it's almost as good as "use warnings."</td></tr></table></div></p>

    <p>So you're probably wondering, "What happens if I take those lines out?" Let's give it a try and 
      see what happens. Remove the code in <del>red</del> as shown:</p>
  
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO EDIT:</div><div class="listing"><pre>#!/usr/bin/perl
<del>use strict;
use warnings;</del>
print "Hello, world!\n";
</pre></div></div>
    
   <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it.</p> 
     
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE TERMINAL SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~/perl1$ <ins>./hello_world.pl</ins>
Hello, world!
cold:~/perl1$ 
</pre></div></div>
     
      <p>No difference, right? That's because 
      we wrote a good program to begin with. Now let's mess with it a bit. Don't be shy about this, 
      because you're going to mess programs up accidentally anyway; we all do. Try leaving out one of the 
      quotation marks. Edit your code as shown below, removing the <del>red</del> quotation mark:</p>
    
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO EDIT:</div><div class="listing"><pre>#!/usr/bin/perl
print "Hello, world!\n<del><b>"</b></del>;
</pre></div></div>
  
    
   <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it.</p>
   
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE TERMINAL SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~/perl1$ <ins>./hello_world.pl</ins>
Can't find string terminator '"' anywhere before EOF at ./hello_world.pl line 2.
cold:~/perl1$ 
</pre></div></div>
   
      <p>Now, Perl can detect <i>that</i> 
      mistake without any help from <span class="purple">use strict</span> or <span class="purple">use warnings</span>! 
      Let's try another experiment. Add the <ins> blue</ins> code as shown:</p>

  
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE:</div><div class="listing"><pre>#!/usr/bin/perl
print<ins><b>:</b></ins> "Hello, world!\n<ins><b>"</b></ins>;
</pre></div></div>
    
   <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it.
      What happens? (We're not going to tell you—you'll just have to try it!)</p>
  
    <p>Okay, now put the two <ins>use</ins> lines back, keeping the colon in as shown:</p>

<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO EDIT:</div><div class="listing"><pre>#!/usr/bin/perl
<ins>use strict;
use warnings;</ins>
print: "Hello, world!\n";
</pre></div></div>
    
   <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it.
      Now what happens?</p>
  
 </div>
 <a name="h_04"></a><div class="heading">Our Second Program</div><div class="headingText">
 
    <p>Let's try a new program that's similar to the first one you created, but with different code. Create  
      a new Perl file in the editor. Select <b>New File</b> from the

   <p>Go ahead and copy the code from hello_world.pl into the new file 
   (we'll let you copy just this once, since you typed it yourself in the 
   first place, but don't get used to it!) and then 
      add the code in <ins>blue</ins> as shown:</p>

<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE:</div><div class="listing"><pre>#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;  

print "Hello, world!\n";

<ins>die "Farewell, cruel world!\n";</ins>
</pre></div></div>

   <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and 
     name it <b>hello_world2.pl</b>. Now run it: </p>
   
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE TERMINAL SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~/perl1$ <ins>./hello_world2.pl</ins>
Hello, world!
Farewell, cruel world!
cold:~/perl1$ 
</pre></div></div>
    
   <p>This program used a new function, <span class="darkgreen">die()</span>. It might look like 
      <span class="darkgreen">die()</span> does the same things as <span class="darkgreen">print()</span>—they both 
     send a string to the screen—but that's not the case. Add the <ins>blue</ins> code 
     to the program as shown:</p>

<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE:</div><div class="listing"><pre>#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;  
          
print "Hello, world!\n";
          
die "Farewell, cruel world!\n";
<ins>
print "Hello again.\n";
</ins> 
</pre></div></div>
      
   <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it:</p>
     
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE TERMINAL SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~/perl1$ <ins>./hello_world2.pl</ins>
Hello, world!
Farewell, cruel world!
cold:~/perl1$

     <p><ins>Hello again.</ins> is not printed this time.  You can see why 
       <span class="darkgreen">die</span> has its name—it causes the program 
       to stop right after it prints its argument.</p>

    <p>Perl programs are often referred to as scripts, but some people think that means they're not 
      intended for serious work, so we'll call them programs throughout this course. Unlike, say, 
      C or Java programs, Perl programs do not get compiled into a different 
      file that you run. So you never have to wonder whether your source 
      code is the same version as the one you're running—they're the same file!</p>
    
    <p>So is Perl a procedural language, a functional language, or an object-oriented language? 
    Yes, yes, and yes. Perl has elements of all of those types of languages. In this course, we will not be 
      exercising the object-oriented aspect, and functional programming in Perl is usually more of 
      an academic exercise than anything else. We're going to focus our efforts on structured, 
      procedural programming.</p>

    <p><i>Structured</i> means that the program is composed of blocks for handling loops and 
      conditions, instead of executing one command after another or executing commands at random.</p> 

    <p><i>Procedural</i> means that the program places sections of code that perform specific functions
      into special blocks that have names which allow them to be referred to from other places within the 
      code; in Perl these blocks are called <i>subroutines</i>. This is also referred to as 
      <i>modular</i> programming.</p>
  
   <p>Some languages require you to write only in object-oriented code, 
   as opposed to the conventional model, in which a program is seen as a list of 
   tasks (subroutines) to perform. Perl is not such a 
      language.</p>

    <p>Some practices are good to incorporate no matter the language you're using. One 
      of them is <i>constant refactoring</i>. Whenever we develop a program, we usually start out
      with a short list of tasks it needs to execute. When we get the program working, we usually 
      congratulate ourselves, and put it aside. But our work rarely ends there. Usually we'll need to go back and 
      add more capabilities to the program. This is especially true if we did a good job to begin 
      with; people like our work and want more of the same good quality programming to do more for them.
      Pretty soon a program that was originally designed to 
      perform one little task can grow to do a hundred more. If we don't continually adjust 
      the design of the program to correspond to its expanding purposes, it is likely to become an unwieldy bunch of 
      parts added together without coordination, like an apartment complex grown from a tool shed:</p>

    <p>So as you revise your programs, keep looking for ways to execute the same tasks while 
    improving the design of the code (this is called "refactoring"). 
      One efficient way to refactor is to look for code that is repeated and figure out a way to remove 
      the duplication.</p>
    
    <p>Be sure to make some deliberate errors in your programs during the lessons to see what happens 
      (accidental errors are fine as well). Let's give it a try. Modify your <b>hello_world2.pl</b> as shown:</p>
      
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO EDIT:</div><div class="listing"><pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;  
          
print "Hello, world!\n"<del>;</del>
          
die "Farewell, cruel world!\n";

print "Hello again.\n";
</pre></div></div>        
     
   <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it to see what happens. Now, modify it again as shown:</p> 
   
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO EDIT:</div><div class="listing"><pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;  
          
print "Hello, world!\n"<ins>,</ins>
          
die "Farewell, cruel world!\n";

print "Hello again.\n";
</pre></div></div>        
     
   <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it to see what happens. Replace the semicolon as shown:</p> 
   
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO EDIT:</div><div class="listing"><pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;  
          
print "Hello, world!\n"<ins>;</ins>
          
die "Farewell, cruel world!\n";

print "Hello again.\n";
</pre></div></div>        
   
   <p>The semicolon is a <i>statement separator</i> in Perl; 
      you can put multiple statements on one line or (more commonly) split statements across several 
      lines—Perl doesn't care. Since the end of the line doesn't indicate to Perl where one statement 
      ends and another begins, something else has to—our friend the semicolon. 
      <i>The shebang line at the top of the program does not count as a statement.</i></p>
    
    <p>It isn't crucial that you understand the meaning of an error
    message entirely, so long as you can locate the error and handle it. But if you do want a more detailed 
      explanation of your error messages, add the code in <ins>blue</ins> near the top of the 
      program and add the colon again as shown:</p>
 
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO EDIT:</div><div class="listing"><pre>#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;
<ins>use diagnostics;</ins>
print<ins><b>:</b></ins> "Hello, world!\n";
die "Farewell, cruel world!\n";
print "Hello again.\n";
</pre></div></div>
    
   <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it
   to see what happens.</p>
    
    <p>What do you suppose the two-character sequence <ins>\n</ins> in the 
      <span class="darkgreen">print()</span> string does? Try leaving it out, then try adding another one in the 
      middle. Of course, you aren't expected to understand the code completely just yet, but we'll 
      get there.</p>  
 
   <a name="s_01"></a><div id="s_01"><div class="subheading">perldoc -f</div><div class="subheadingText">
     
     <p>There are many built-in functions in Perl, all documented in the giant page that you get 
       with <b>perldoc perlfunc</b>. That page is so huge that searching 
       through it for the function you want would result in certain agony. Fortunately, there is an alternative to perldoc that 
       shows you just the part of perlfunc for the function you specify. You get that with the <b>-f</b> option 
       to perldoc. Try it in the Unix (or Unix 2) shell. Type the <ins>blue</ins> code as shown:</p>
     
     <div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE:</div><div class="listing"><pre>cold:~/perl1$ <ins>perldoc -f print</ins>
     </pre></div></div>
     
     <p>You can scroll through the test using the up and down arrows on your keyboard, then when you're ready,
       exit the page by typing <b>q</b>.</p>
     
     <p>You can find the functions listed alphabetically and by category at <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/perlfunc.html" target="_blank">http://perldoc.perl.org/perlfunc.html</a>.</p>
   </div></div>
    
  <p>Phew! That was a long lesson. But you've got a good foundation to build on as we go 
 forward learning Perl. You're doing great so far!  Be sure and go back to your syllabus page and complete the 
    Lesson 1 quizzes and projects to make sure you're ready to move on to the next lesson.  See you there!</p>
