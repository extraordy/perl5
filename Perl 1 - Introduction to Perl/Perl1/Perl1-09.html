  <p>Imagine you're watching one of those late-night infomercials hawking steak knives and sandwich 
   makers. Only this time, they're saying, "Are you tired of measuring string lengths and adding spaces 
   by hand to get output that lines up in columns? Have you ever wanted to zero-fill a number or print 
   one to a certain number of decimal places? Well, look no further! You need <b>printf</b>, the amazing
   built-in Perl function! It formats numbers! It formats strings! It knows about octal, hexadecimal, 
   and binary! But wait—there's more! You also get scientific notation, <i>and</i> left and right 
   justification, absolutely free! Now how much would you pay?"</p>
  
  <a name="s_01"></a><div id="s_01"><div class="subheading">printf()</div><div class="subheadingText">
   
   <p>
    Fortunately, you don't have to pay anything—Perl is free! Even so, <span class="darkgreen">printf</span> is pretty
    amazing, so we're going to spend some time getting familiar with it.
   </p>
   
   <p><span class="darkgreen">printf</span> is similar to <span class="darkgreen">print</span>—it prints its arguments—but in  
    <span class="darkgreen">printf</span> there's an <b>f</b> which stands for "formatted." The general syntax 
    of <span class="darkgreen">printf</span> is:
   </p>
   
   <p><span class="darkgreen">printf</span> <span class="orange"><i>format</i></span>, argument, ... </p>
   
   <p>This is a type of <i>data-driven programming</i>; the <i>format</i> (the first argument) is a 
    string to be printed, but it may contain special characters that will be replaced by formatted 
    versions of the subsequent arguments.</p>
    
    <p>Let's try an example.  Create a file called <b>printf.pl</b> as shown:</p>

<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE:</div><div class="listing"><pre><ins>#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

printf "I'm an ordinary string.\n";
printf "Here's a number in a field of 10 characters: &lt;%10d&gt;\n", 42;
printf "Here's a date: %02d/%02d/%4d\n", 7, 4, 1776;
my $PI = 3.14159265358979;
printf "PI to 3 decimal places = %.3f\n", $PI;
printf "PI to 4 decimal places = %.4f\n", $PI;
my $places = 5;
printf "PI to $places decimal places = %.*f\n", $places, $PI;
my $integer = 161;
printf "$integer in octal       = %o\n", $integer;
printf "$integer in hexadecimal = %x\n", $integer;
printf "$integer in binary      = %b\n", $integer;
printf "%10s-justified string; %-10s-justified string\n", qw&lt;right left&gt;;</ins>
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it. </p>

   <p>Wow! That's 
    a lot of capability for one function, isn't it? And we've 
    barely scratched the surface of what <span class="darkgreen">printf</span> can do. Now, at this point you 
    might consider rushing to <b>perldoc -f printf</b> or 
    <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/functions/printf.html" target="_blank">http://perldoc.perl.org/functions/print.html</a> to learn all the details you can 
     about <span class="darkgreen">printf</span>. But you won't find them there. There's another function 
     called <span class="darkgreen">sprintf</span> (which along with 
    <span class="darkgreen">printf</span> may be familiar to you if you're already a C programmer). 
    <span class="darkgreen">sprintf</span> is just like <span class="darkgreen">printf</span> except that instead of 
    printing the formatted string, it returns it. Check out this <b>sprintf</b> example:</p>
   
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE:</div><div class="observe"><pre>
<span class="darkred">$title</span> = <span class="darkgreen">sprintf</span> <span class="orange">"Report of store #%4d for %02d/%02d\n"</span>, 
<span class="darkred">$storenum</span>, <span class="darkred">$month</span>, <span class="darkred">$day</span>;
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p>
    Information about the elements that can go into the <i>format</i> argument is identical for 
    both <span class="darkgreen">sprintf</span> and <span class="darkgreen">printf</span>. Rather than write the 
    same information twice in the documentation, 
    the developers of Perl included the format argument information once, in <span class="darkgreen">sprintf</span>. 
    You can find out all about 
    those things beginning with % (called <b>conversions</b>) through <b>perldoc -f sprintf</b> or 
        <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/functions/sprintf.html" target="_blank">http://perldoc.perl.org/functions/sprintf.html</a>.
   </p>
   
   <p>
    By the way, I snuck in one extra thing in <span class="darkred">printf.pl</span>; did you spot it? The 
    <span class="darkgreen">qw</span> operator isn't using parentheses to delimit its argument 
    <span class="orange">right left</span>; it uses angle brackets instead. You can use any "paired" group of 
    delimiting characters you want instead of parentheses, such as angle brackets (<b>&lt;&gt;</b>), square 
    brackets (<b>[]</b>), or curly brackets (<b>{}</b>). 
   </p>
   
   <p>
    The sheer range of things that <span class="darkgreen">printf</span> can do means that the documentation (for
    <span class="darkgreen">sprintf</span>) is pretty long. I'll summarize  some of the most useful parts. 
   </p>
   
   <p>Everything in the string that is the first argument to <span class="darkgreen">printf</span> will get 
    printed out just as it is, with the exception of <b>conversions</b> beginning with a % character. Because these conversions are done at run-time, you can supply that first argument in any number of ways: 
    as a single-quoted string, a double-quoted string, or a scalar. It's common to 
    use a double-quoted string so that we can put a newline where we need it using <b>\n</b>. 
    When you do use a double-quoted string, scalars and arrays will interpolate in it, 
    so make sure you don't use double-quoted strings if your scalars and arrays might contain % signs that you don't want. 
    Usually,
    if you want to output a string that's in a scalar, you'll use the <b>%s</b> conversion:
   </p>
   
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE:</div><div class="observe"><pre>
<span class="darkgreen">printf</span> <span class="orange">"Here's a string: $scalar"</span>;      # Not recommended
<span class="darkgreen">printf</span> <span class="orange">"Here's a string: %s"</span>, <span class="darkred">$scalar</span>;  # Preferred
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p>
    Here are the most common conversions:
   </p>
   
   <ul><li>
     %s: string
    </li><li>
     %d: integer
    </li><li>
     %f: floating-point number
    </li><li>
     %o, %x, %b: octal, hexadecimal, and binary, respectively
    </li><li>
     %%: a percent character
    </li></ul>
   
   <p>
    Each one of those will format the output using exactly the space required, but you can change that. 
    By putting a number between the % and the letter, you can pad the conversion result with spaces on 
    the left so that it is right-justified in a field of the specified number of characters. If you put a minus sign 
    in front of the number, it left-justifies:
   </p>
   
   <div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: printf justification</div><div class="observe"><pre>
<span class="darkgreen">printf</span> <span class="orange">"|%8d|\n"</span>, <span class="orange">123</span>;    # prints |     123|
<span class="darkgreen">printf</span> <span class="orange">"|%-8d|\n"</span>, <span class="orange">123</span>;   # prints |123     |
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p>
    The vertical bars in these examples are there to indicate the boundaries of 
    the resulting fields. Width and justification works for all of the conversions listed above. If 
    you specify a width that is actually narrower than what you're printing, Perl ignores the width. There is no "center" 
    justification.
   </p>
   
   <p>
    For the <b>%d</b> conversion, you can prefix a width with a zero to get zero fill instead of
    space padding: 
   </p>
   
   <div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: zero filling</div><div class="observe"><pre>
<span class="darkgreen">printf</span> <span class="orange">"|%012d|\n"</span>, <span class="orange">234523</span>;   # prints |000000234523|
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p>
    For the <b>%f</b> conversion, you usually specify a <i>precision</i> in addition to a width; the 
    precision is given as a number after a period following the width. Take a look at this
    example of <b>floating-point precision</b>:
   </p>
   
   <div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: floating-point precision</div><div class="observe"><pre>
<span class="darkgreen">printf</span> <span class="orange">"|%12.6f|\n"</span>, <span class="orange">234.523</span>;   # prints |  234.523000|
</pre></div></div>
         
   <p>
    The default precision is 6. You can omit the width and just specify the number of digits to print 
    after the decimal point. Here's an example that uses <b>floating-point decimal places</b>:
   </p>
   
   <div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: floating-point decimal places</div><div class="observe"><pre>
<span class="darkgreen">printf</span> <span class="orange">"|%.2f|\n"</span>, <span class="orange">234.523</span>;   # prints |234.52|
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p>
    For the <b>%s</b> conversion, precision is interpreted as a maximum field width; the string will be
    truncated from the right as necessary to fit:
   </p>

<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: string precision</div><div class="observe"><pre>
<span class="darkgreen">printf</span> <span class="orange">"|%.6s|\n"</span>, <span class="orange">"abcdefghi"</span>;    # prints |abcdef|
<span class="darkgreen">printf</span> <span class="orange">"|%8.6s|\n"</span>, <span class="orange">"abcdefghi"</span>;   # prints |  abcdef|
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p>
    <b>Scientific Notation</b><br>
    Sometimes you need to deal in numbers that are so big (or so small) that the number of digits makes them hard to read.
    Scientists have to do this all the time, which is why they invented <i>scientific notation</i>, a way of expressing
    those numbers with a floating point number in the range 1 to (just under) 10 and a power of ten to multiply the result by.
    So 299792458 (speed of light in meters per second) can be represented as 2.99792458 times 10 to the power 8, which is written as
    <b>2.99792458E+08</b>, and 0.00000000000000000000000000091093829 (mass of an electron in grams) can be written as <b>9.10938291E-28</b>.
   </p>
   <p>
    Perl can use those scientific notation numbers as program literals. A plus sign after the E is optional; so are leading zeros in the digits
    following the E (called the <i>exponent</i>), and the E can be upper
    or lower case.  You can also print them out, using <span class="darkgreen">printf</span>:
   </p>
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: scientific notation</div><div class="observe"><pre>
<span class="darkgreen">printf</span> <span class="orange">"Light-year in meters: %e"</span>, 2.99792458E8 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 365.24;  # prints Light-year in meters: 9.460471e+15
</pre></div></div>
   <p>
    You can see there a literal scientific number (speed of light in meters per second), and the output from the <b>%e</b> 
    conversion is in scientific notation.  There is also a friendly <b>%g</b> conversion that will use <b>%e</b> if the 
    number is very big (or small) and <b>%f</b> otherwise.
   </p>
   <p>
    We'll do another <span class="darkgreen">printf</span> example shortly, right after we've learned another 
    piece of syntax.
   </p>
 
  </div></div>
 </div>
 <a name="h_02"></a><div class="heading">foreach Loops</div><div class="headingText">
  
   <p>
    Here's the general form of a <span class="purple">foreach</span> loop:
   </p>

<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: foreach statement form</div><div class="observe"><pre>
<span class="purple">foreach</span> <span class="darkred"><i>variable</i></span>( <span class="orange"><i>list</i></span> )
{
  <span class="green"><i>code...</i></span>
}
</pre></div></div>
  
   <p>
    The <span class="darkred"><i>variable</i></span> will be set in turn, to each of the elements of the 
    <span class="orange"><i>list</i></span>, and the <span class="green"><i>code</i></span> will be executed each time. Usually (but 
    not always, as you'll see shortly), you'll reference the variable in the code so that the code does 
    something different each time. 
   </p>
   <p>
    Here are a couple of examples:
   </p>
   
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE:</div><div class="observe"><pre>
<span class="purple">foreach</span> <span class="darkred">$fruit</span>( <span class="darkred">@fruits</span> )
{
  print "Found a $fruit\n";
}
</pre></div></div>
   
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE:</div><div class="observe"><pre>
# $lines contains lines that look like:
# SKU cost cost cost ...
<span class="purple">foreach</span> <span class="darkred">my $line</span>( <span class="darkgreen">split</span> <span class="orange">"\n"</span>, <span class="darkred">$lines</span> )
{
  <span class="purple">my</span> (<span class="darkred">$sku</span>, <span class="darkred">@costs</span>) = <span class="darkgreen">split</span> <span class="orange">" "</span>, <span class="darkred">$line</span>;
  <span class="purple">my</span> $total = 0;
  print "SKU $sku has total cost ";
  <span class="purple">foreach</span> <span class="darkred">my $cost</span>( <span class="darkred">@costs</span> )
  {
    $total += $cost;
  }
  print "$total\n";
}
</pre></div></div>
  
  <a name="s_01"></a><div id="s_01"><div class="subheading">The .. Range Operator</div><div class="subheadingText">
  
   <p>
    Sometimes you'll want to execute the same piece of code a certain number of times without regard to
    any loop variable. In such a case, you could write code that looks like this:
   </p>
   
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: repetitious Loop</div><div class="observe"><pre>
<span class="purple">foreach</span> <span class="darkred">my $whatever</span> ( 1, 2, 3 )
{
  print "I tell you three times\n";
}  
</pre></div></div>
  
   <p>
    If you wanted to go around the loop a hundred times, you'd have to do a lot of typing! This is where 
    the <i>range operator</i> comes in handy:
  </p>
  
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: range operator</div><div class="observe"><pre>
<span class="orange"><i>number1</i></span> <span class="darkgreen">..</span> <span class="orange"><i>number2</i></span>
</pre></div></div>
  
   <p>
    An expression of this form evaluates to the <i>list</i> of all the numbers in the range 
    <i>number1</i> to <i>number2</i>, inclusive. So we could rewrite the loop above as: 
   </p>

<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE:</div><div class="observe"><pre>
<span class="purple">foreach</span> <span class="darkred">my $whatever</span> ( 1 .. 3 )
{
  print "I tell you three times\n";
}  
</pre></div></div>
  
   <p>
    Now, if we want to change our code to make it go around the loop a hundred times, it won't be a problem. It's 
    also less difficult to set parameters: 
   </p> 
   
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE:</div><div class="observe"><pre>
<span class="purple">my</span> <span class="darkred">$count</span> = <span class="orange">3</span>;
<span class="purple">foreach</span> <span class="darkred">my $whatever</span> ( 1 .. $count )
{
  print "I tell you $count times\n";
}  
</pre></div></div>
  
   <p>
    Now let's use <span class="purple">foreach</span> in a <span class="darkgreen">printf</span> example. You may remember this 
    program from lesson 6:
  </p>

<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: store.pl</div><div class="observe"><pre>

my ($peaches_sold, $avocados_sold, $durien_sold, $apples_sold) = (12, 6, -1, 24);  # One durien returned... too smelly
my ($line1, $line2, $line3, $line4) = split "\n", $lines;

    just like the input.
   </p>
   
   <p>
    By the way, some of the input lines in this program begin with spaces to allow 
    the <i>costs</i> to line up, yet <span class="darkgreen">split()</span> still does the right thing. That's 
    because <span class="darkgreen">split()</span>  
    ignores any whitespace at the beginning of the string when its splitting on whitespace. 
    That's one of those really handy Perl behaviors that you may not even notice.

   <p>
    If you're slightly uncomfortable with the fact that the program we've got depends on the input and the array 
    <span class="darkred">@sold</span> being in the same order, good! That's how a programmer should think! We'll find out what 
    to do about that dilemma later.
