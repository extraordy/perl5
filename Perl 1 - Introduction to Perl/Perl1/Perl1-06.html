  <div class="c"><p>"Enough organization, enough lists, and I think we can control the uncontrollable."<br>
   -John Mankiewicz</p></div>
  
  <p>Most people run their lives using lists, like shopping lists, calendars, address books, even lists of 
   the lists they've made!</p>
  
  <a name="h_01"></a><div class="heading">Lists</div><div class="headingText">
   
   <p>Perl has lists, too. You've been using them for a while. In this lesson, you're going to 
    get to know and understand them a lot better.</p>
   
   <p>There's an important distinction to make about lists: they are <i>not</i> variables like scalars are. 
   Lists hold data, but they don't have <i>names</i>. You can store a list in a variable (not a scalar, 
   but a different kind of variable. We'll see how to do that in the next 
    lesson). But a list itself is an ordered set of scalar <i>values</i> flying around between 
    different parts of your program.</p>
   
   <p>A list shows up in your program in these ways:</p>
   
   <ul><li>When you assign something to a series of scalars between parentheses separated by commas:<br>
     <br>
     <div class="c"> (<span class="darkred">$first_name</span>, <span class="darkred">$middle_initial</span>, <span class="darkred">$last_name</span>) = ...</div><br>
   
     The set of scalars there is the list. Whatever is on the right side of the equals sign 
     will be expected to produce a list that can be assigned to those scalars.<br><br><br>
    </li><li>When you pass arguments to a function that expects a list (most of them do), like 
     <span class="darkgreen">print</span>:<br><br>
     <div class="c"><span class="darkgreen">print</span> <span class="darkred">$first_name</span>, " ", <span class="darkred">$middle_initial</span>, ". ", 
      <span class="darkred">$last_name</span>;</div><br>
     The parentheses are optional in this case.  
    </li></ul>
   <br><br>
   <p>There's more to the whole notion of functions <i>expecting</i> a list, but for now let's keep building on the stuff we know.
   (We have an entire lesson dedicated to the intricacies of lists later.)</p>
   
   <p>We can <i>declare</i> more than one variable at a time in a list:</p>
   
   <div class="c"><p>my (<span class="darkred">$x</span>, <span class="green">$y</span>, <span class="darkblue">$z</span>);</p></div>
   
   <p>We can <i>assign</i> values to more than one variable at a time in a 
    list:</p>
   
   <div class="c"><p>(<span class="darkred">$x</span>, <span class="green">$y</span>, <span class="darkblue">$z</span>) = (<span class="darkred">17</span>, <span class="green">24</span>, 
    <span class="darkblue">42</span>);</p></div>
   
   <p>We can <i>initialize</i> (declare and assign at the same time) in a list:</p>
   
   <div class="c"><p>my (<span class="darkred">$x</span>, <span class="green">$y</span>, <span class="darkblue">$z</span>) = (<span class="darkred">17</span>, <span class="green">24</span>, 
    <span class="darkblue">42</span>);</p></div>
   <p>
    The contents to the right side of the equals sign in the last two examples are also lists. They contain <i>literal</i> 
    elements—that's the technical term for the values specified at that point in the program, not coming from a 
    variable.</p>
   
   <p>Let's check out an example to see what happens when the number of things on the 
    left side is different from the number of things right side of the equals sign. Create a new file called 
    <b>list_test.pl</b>as shown:</p>

<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE:</div><div class="listing"><pre><ins>#!/usr/bin/perl

my ($a, $b, $c, $d);
($a, $b) = (17, 24, 42);  # Too few targets
print "\$a = $a, \$b = $b\n";
($a, $b, $c, $d) = (17, 24, 42);   # Too many targets
print "\$a = $a, \$b = $b, \$c = $c, \$d = $d\n";
</ins></pre></div></div>

$a = 17, $b = 24, $c = 42, $d =

   <p>What happened? Ponder and absorb.</p>

   <p><span class="darkgreen">split()</span> works by splitting the <i>second</i> 
    argument wherever it sees an instance of the <i>first</i> argument, and returning the <i>list</i> 
    of strings that it finds.
   (By the way, when I'm writing about a function, often I'll put parentheses after it like I just did, to help
    you realize that I'm talking about a function.  It doesn't mean anything about whether or not parentheses
    are required - you'll see I used none in the code above.)</p>
   
   <p>Here's a graphical representation:</p>
   
   <p><div class="c"><img src="images/split.png"></div></p>
   
   <p>The first argument—first a newline, then a space, in the above example—is <i>not</i> 
    included in the resulting strings. Instead, <span class="darkgreen">split()</span> returns the things in 
    between. Also, <span class="darkgreen">split()</span> does not modify the argument you pass it—even 
    though Perl programmers may refer to those strings as having been being split, the original string has not actually changed. </p>
   
   <p>Also, when using <span class="darkgreen">split()</span>, the string you use to execute a split 
    (the first argument) does not have to be a single character. If, however, that string is a 
    single space (like we used in our example above), then Perl will split its second argument wherever it sees <i>any number</i> of 
    consecutive spaces or tab characters as the string. That's the reason  
    splitting the grocery store lines on a single space worked, even though there were multiple 
    spaces between the items in the string.</p>
   
   <p>Let's try one last example using <span class="darkblue">split()</span>; change <b>store.pl</b> as shown:</p>

   <p>This output isn't very useful, 
    is it? Do you understand why you got it? (Hint: Take a look at the last example of lists you created.) So, 
    how can we fix it? There's a third, optional argument for <span class="darkgreen">split()</span> that tells 
    Perl to stop splitting after it reaches a specified number of fields.</p>

   <p>The lines that are produced aren't quite the same as the ones that 
    were entered. The numbers are different and there is only one space between each item, 
    because that's what we told <span class="darkgreen">join()</span> to do. 
    Because that output can be parsed by the same program, the number of spaces usually doesn't 
    matter. If, however, some other (less tolerant) program expects the lines to be composed of 
    fixed-width fields, then we'd have a problem (one that we will learn to solve later).</p>
   
   <p>Incidentally, a list can have <i>zero</i> or more things in it. 
   Here's what a list with nothing in it looks like:</p>
   
   <p><div class="c"><b>()</b></div></p>

   <p>One final bit of instruction for you in this lesson—you see that <span class="darkblue">-=</span> in the program?  
   That's a handy Perl shortcut to use when you want to apply a <i>binary</i> operator (an operator that takes two 
    arguments, one on each side—like <span class="darkblue">+</span>, or <span class="darkblue">*</span>) and then have the variable on 
    the left side of the operator be assigned the result of the calculation; in other 
    words and code: </p><br>
   <p><div class="c"><span class="darkred">$variable</span> <i>OP</i>= <i>EXPRESSION</i></div></p><br>
   
   <p>is the same as writing:</p><br>
   
   <p><div class="c"><span class="darkred">$variable</span> = <span class="darkred">$variable</span> <i>OP</i> <i>EXPRESSION</i></div></p><br>
   
   <p>where <i>OP</i> is any binary operator, and <i>EXPRESSION</i> is any expression. So:</p><br>
   
   <p><div class="c"><span class="darkred">$quantity</span> -= <span class="darkred">$peaches_sold</span></div></p><br>
   
   <p>is the same as:</p><br>
   
   <p><div class="c"><span class="darkred">$quantity</span> = <span class="darkred">$quantity</span> - <span class="darkred">$peaches_sold</span></div></p><br>
   
   <p>This shortcut saves us time when programming and makes our code very readable.</p>

 <p>Looking great so far! In the next lesson we'll learn about arrays!  See you there!</p>
