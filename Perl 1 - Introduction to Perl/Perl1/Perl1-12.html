  <p>We're about three-quarters of the way through the course and you already have the skills to create 
   some really useful programs. But there's still lots more to learn about Perl! Let's go over one of the 
   most important features of the language: <b>hashes</b>. </p> 
   
   <p>Before the invention of Perl, most languages didn't include 
   the hash data type, but it became apparent right away that this type was extremely useful. Nearly 
   every language invented after Perl includes hashes. And virtually every program you'll ever write to 
   perform a real task will use this data type. </p>
  
  <a name="s_01"></a><div id="s_01"><div class="subheading">Getting Started with Hashes</div><div class="subheadingText">
   
   <p>If you've worked in other languages (or earlier versions of Perl), you might already understand the concept of a 
    key&nbsp;=&gt;&nbsp;value structure as an <i>associative array</i> or <i>dictionary</i>. In current Perl, it's called a hash. </p>
   
   <p>A hash contains <i>elements</i>, each of which consists of a pair of scalars: a <i>key</i> and 
    a <i>value</i>. (Technically, the <i>key</i> is a really a string. You'll learn about the distinctions between them 
    in later Perl courses.)</p>
   
   <p>A hash (like an array) is an <i>aggregate</i>: it may contain zero or more elements. 
   But unlike an array, there is <i>no order</i> to the elements within a hash. </p>
   
   <p>You might think that's weird, especially if you know that computer memory is arranged in linear order; 
   surely the elements <i>have</i> to be in <i>some</i> order, right? Well, in fact there is a kind of order to them, but 
   it won't make any sense to you, it isn't 
    useful for anything, and it can change without warning. We'll just let it go at that and avoid unnecessary confusion!</p>
   
   <p>When you store an element in a hash, you must specify the key and the value. If the element 
    with that key already exists, the value is overwritten; if it does not exist, then it is created. When 
    you retrieve an element, you specify the key and you get back the value. So, the keys of a 
    hash are all unique, but the values do not need to be unique.</p>
   
   <p>Okay, let's see how this works with a return to Echidna Eric's Insect Emporium! Create a file
   called <b>emporium.pl</b> as shown:</p>
   
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE:</div><div class="listing"><pre><ins>#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

my (%count, %cost);
$count{'ants'}        = 47_000;
$count{'fleas'}       = 240_000;
$count{'beetles'}     = 520;
$count{'fruit flies'} = 1_500_000;

$cost{'ants'}        = 0.10;
$cost{'fleas'}       = 0.04;
$cost{'beetles'}     = 0.02;
$cost{'fruit flies'} = 0.001;

my $insect = 'ants';
print "Value of $insect on hand = ", $count{$insect} * $cost{$insect}, "\n";
</ins></pre></div></div>
   
   <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it. </p>
   
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE TERMINAL SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~$ <ins>cd perl1</ins>
cold:~/perl1$ <ins>./emporium.pl</ins>
Value of ants on hand = 4700
cold:~/perl1$    
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p>Check to make sure you get the correct result. Now try changing the value of <span class="darkred">$insect</span> to 
    <span class="darkblue">'fleas'</span>, <span class="darkblue">'beetles'</span>, and <span class="darkblue">'fruit flies'</span> in turn and see if 
    you get the right results for those values too. 
    Finally, try setting <span class="darkred">$insect</span> to a different value of your choice.</p>
   
   <p>Okay, now let's dissect this script:</p>
   
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: Hash Declaration</div><div class="observe"><pre>
<span class="purple">my</span> (<span class="darkred">%count</span>, <span class="darkred">%cost</span>);    
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p>This line declares two hashes. Because it's a new data type, the hash begins with a new punctuation
    character, the percent sign (<b>%</b>). We won't use <b>%</b> very often because most of the time our programs 
    will refer to individual hash elements rather than the hash that contains them. But we need to 
    name the full hash when declaring it initially.</p>
   
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: Hash Element Population</div><div class="observe"><pre>
<span class="darkred">$count</span>{<span class="orange">'ants'</span>} = <span class="orange">47_000</span>;  
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p>This line puts an element in the hash <span class="darkred">%count</span>. The element's key is <span class="orange">'ants'</span>
    and its value is <span class="orange">47_000</span>. (Remember, the underscore in a literal integer is 
    ignored; use it where we would use a comma to write out the entire number.) If there had 
    already been an element in that hash with the <span class="orange">'ants'</span> key, its value would have been overwritten with 
    <span class="orange">47_000</span>.</p>
   
   <p>Just as with arrays, each individual value of a hash is a scalar, so when we refer to it, we 
    use a dollar sign <b>$</b> to remind us that we're getting a scalar. When you see a dollar sign <b>$</b>
    followed by a name and something inside curly brackets <b>{}</b>, you're looking at a reference to a hash 
    value whose key is found within those curly brackets <b>{}</b>. </p>
   
   <H4>Reading Hash Values</H4>
   <p>If we use that same syntax inside an expression instead of assigning to it, then we 
    <i>fetch</i> the value from the hash corresponding to the key between the curly brackets <b>{}</b>. If there 
    is no element in the hash with that key, we get the undefined value. (And yes, you can store the 
    undefined value in a hash value; later we'll find out how to tell the difference between an undefined hash value and 
    a hash element that's not there at all.)</p>
   
   <p>We've used a variable as the key in our example. Now let's modify <b>emporium.pl</b> to use a literal as the key: </p>
   
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO EDIT:</div><div class="listing"><pre>#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;
    
my (%count, %cost);
$count{'ants'}        = 47_000;
$count{'fleas'}       = 240_000;
$count{'beetles'}     = 520;
$count{'fruit flies'} = 1_500_000;
    
$cost{'ants'}        = 0.10;
$cost{'fleas'}       = 0.04;
$cost{'beetles'}     = 0.02;
$cost{'fruit flies'} = 0.001;
    
<ins>print "Value of ants on hand = ", $count{'ants'} * $cost{'ants'}, "\n";</ins>
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it. </p>
   
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE TERMINAL SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~/perl1$ <ins>./emporium.pl</ins>
Value of ants on hand = 4700

   <p>A hash is like an array, but instead of having a numeric index 
    that starts at zero and increases by one for each element, the hash index is whatever you deem it to be. 
    Instead of square brackets, hash elements have curly brackets and finally, instead of just numbers in the index position, 
    hashes have arbitrary strings. 
  </p>
   
   <p>There is one really helpful piece of syntactic sugar we can use when writing hash elements 
    with literal keys. Change the last line of <b>emporium.pl</b> like this: </p>
   
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO EDIT:</div><div class="listing"><pre>#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;
    
my (%count, %cost);
$count{'ants'}        = 47_000;
$count{'fleas'}       = 240_000;
$count{'beetles'}     = 520;
$count{'fruit flies'} = 1_500_000;
    
$cost{'ants'}        = 0.10;
$cost{'fleas'}       = 0.04;
$cost{'beetles'}     = 0.02;
$cost{'fruit flies'} = 0.001;
    
<ins>print "Value of ants on hand = ", $count{ants} * $cost{ants}, "\n";</ins>
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it. </p>
   
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE TERMINAL SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~/perl1$ <ins>./emporium.pl</ins>
Value of ants on hand = 4700
cold:~/perl1$    
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p>Our changes made no difference. How come?</p> 
    
   <p>Well, in Perl it's common to use <b>well-behaved</b> strings for 
    literal hash keys (here <b>literal</b> means that we spell out the value of the key itself in the program, 
    rather than put it into a variable first), so we don't need to include
    quotation marks around those strings used as hash keys.</p>
   
   <p><b>Well-behaved</b> means the same thing here as it did it did when we learned about the <b>fat 
    comma</b> (<b>=&gt;</b>) operator: if it obeys the rules for naming a scalar 
    <i>after</i> the dollar sign (see lesson 2), it works. And by the way, the same rules apply to 
    naming an array or a hash—after the at sign (<b>@</b>) or the percent sign (<b>%</b>).</p>
   
   <p>There is one key in both hashes in our current example that cannot have the quotation 
    marks left out when using it as a literal key. Can you tell which one it is? (If not, try 
    removing quotation marks until you get an error.)</p>
  
  </div></div>
  <a name="s_02"></a><div id="s_02"><div class="subheading">Hash Initialization</div><div class="subheadingText">
   
   <p><span class="darkred">emporium.pl</span> contains hashes that are initialized 
    explicitly; they aren't dependent on data that comes from outside of the program. Most hashes in the 
    real world fall into the latter category; they will be populated by data 
    from an external data source when the program is run. </p>
    
    <p>A proper version of 
    <span class="darkred">emporium.pl</span> would likely read the inventory counts and item prices from data 
    files. But there are still lots of good reasons to use explicitly initialized hashes in a program. For 
    example, suppose we were doing date conversions and we wanted to be able to convert a date with 
    an alphabetical month into one with a numeric month. Until now, you might have coded that like 
    this: </p>
   
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE:</div><div class="observe"><pre>
<span class="purple">if</span> ( <span class="darkred">$month_string</span> <span class="darkgreen">eq</span> <span class="orange">'Jan'</span> )
{
  <span class="darkred">$month_number</span> = <span class="orange">1</span>;
}
<span class="purple">elsif</span> ( <span class="darkred">$month_string</span> <span class="darkgreen">eq</span> <span class="orange">'Feb'</span> )
{
  <span class="darkred">$month_number</span> = <span class="orange">2</span>;
}
...
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p>Or you might have come up with an array and a loop, relying on the fact that the corresponding 
    numbers for each month are consecutive small integers that could be array indexes. But now suppose 
    you have a hash <span class="darkred">%month_num</span> with the month strings for keys and the month numbers for values. 
    Your code would slim down drastically, and look something like this: </p>
   
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE:</div><div class="observe"><pre>
<span class="darkred">$month_number</span> = <span class="darkred">$month_num</span>{ <span class="darkred">$month_string</span> };
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p>This code is more concise.
    Instead of varying according to the number of comparisons that have to be made in a 
    multi-way <span class="purple">if</span> statement or loop, the amount of time required 
    to find hash values from their keys is constant. </p>
   
   <p>We don't need to retrieve <span class="darkred">%month_num</span> from outside of the program because we define it within the program. And so
   we don't need to set up twelve assignments like 
    we did in <span class="darkred">emporium.pl</span>. We can populate the hash like this: </p>
   
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE:</div><div class="observe"><pre>
<span class="purple">my</span> <span class="darkred">%month_num</span>;
<span class="darkred">%month_num</span> = ( <span class="orange">'Jan'</span>, <span class="orange">1</span>, <span class="orange">'Feb'</span>, <span class="orange">2</span>, <span class="orange">'Mar'</span>, <span class="orange">3</span>, <span class="orange">'Apr'</span>, <span class="orange">4</span>, <span class="orange">'May'</span>, <span class="orange">5</span>, <span class="orange">'Jun'</span>, <span class="orange">6</span>, <span class="orange">'Jul'</span>, <span class="orange">7</span>, <span class="orange">'Aug'</span>, <span class="orange">8</span>, <span class="orange">'Sep'</span>, <span class="orange">9</span>, <span class="orange">'Oct'</span>, <span class="orange">10</span>, <span class="orange">'Nov'</span>, <span class="orange">11</span>, <span class="orange">'Dec'</span>, <span class="orange">12</span> );
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p>A hash is populated by assigning to it a list that will be interpreted as:</p>
   
   <p><div class="c">( <i>key, value, key, value, key, value,... </i>)</div></p>
   
   <p>There must be an <i>even</i> number of elements in the list or else Perl will give you 
    a warning. Each <i>key</i> precedes its corresponding <i>value</i> in the list. </p>
    
   <p>Even though the list is ordered, when its contents go into the hash, the elements 
    (pairs of values in the list) lose their order. The list <i>overwrites</i> any contents that are already in the 
    hash, replacing them with the elements in the list. (If the list is empty, then the 
    hash will be emptied.)</p>
   
   <p>We can combine declaration with population to get initialization. Awesome. But before we go further 
   with that, think back on the syntactic sugar from the last lesson, particularly the "fat comma." Hash population or 
    initialization are ideal places to use it. Here's what initializing <span class="darkred">%month_num</span> looks 
    like with the fat comma:</p>
     
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE:</div><div class="observe"><pre>
<span class="purple">my</span> <span class="darkred">%month_num</span> = ( <span class="orange">Jan</span> =&gt; <span class="orange">1</span>, <span class="orange">Feb</span> =&gt; <span class="orange">2</span>, <span class="orange">Mar</span> =&gt; <span class="orange">3</span>, <span class="orange">Apr</span> =&gt; <span class="orange">4</span>, <span class="orange">May</span> =&gt; <span class="orange">5</span>, <span class="orange">Jun</span> =&gt; <span class="orange">6</span>, <span class="orange">Jul</span> =&gt; <span class="orange">7</span>, <span class="orange">Aug</span> =&gt; <span class="orange">8</span>, <span class="orange">Sep</span> =&gt; <span class="orange">9</span>, <span class="orange">Oct</span> =&gt; <span class="orange">10</span>, <span class="orange">Nov</span> =&gt; <span class="orange">11</span>, <span class="orange">Dec</span> =&gt; <span class="orange">12</span> );
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p>Using that fat comma makes it clear what the keys and the values are going to be 
    when the list is assigned to the hash. (And remember that a string on the left side of a fat comma 
    must be well-behaved.)</p>
   
   <p>Visualize your hash like this (not 
    all of the elements have been included in order to keep the diagram from becoming too large): </p>
   
   <p><div class="c"><img src="images/hash.png"></div></p>
  
  </div></div>
  <a name="s_03"></a><div id="s_03"><div class="subheading">Iterating through Hashes</div><div class="subheadingText">
   
   <p>The most common action you'll take with a hash is to go through it printing out each key
    and its corresponding value. You already know how to get the value corresponding to a given key;
    you read it from <b><span class="darkred">$hash</span>{<span class="darkred">$key</span>}</b>. But how do you find a key if you 
    don't know one?</p>

   <p>Enter the <span class="darkgreen">keys()</span> function. When you pass this function the name of a

  <a name="s_04"></a><div id="s_04"><div class="subheading">Miscellaneous Hash Functions</div><div class="subheadingText">
   
   <p>Before we learn the many uses for hashes themselves, let's cover a few hash 
    functions: </p>
   
   <H4>exists()</H4>
   
   <p>When you pass the <span class="darkgreen">exists()</span> function a hash element, it returns true if 
    that element is in the hash, and false if it isn't. Here's an example: </p>
   
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: exists()</div><div class="observe"><pre>
<span class="purple">if</span> ( <span class="darkgreen">exists</span> <span class="darkred">$cost{spider}</span> )
{
  <span class="darkgreen">print</span> <span class="orange">"Arachnophobes, beware!\n"</span>;
}
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p>Hey, wait a minute—isn't this going to <i>evaluate</i> the hash element <span class="darkred">$cost{spider}</span> 
    first, and if it's not there, get the undefined value, and then pass that to the 
    <span class="darkgreen">exists()</span> function? That seems like a violation of 
    Perl's rules, doesn't it?</p>
   
   <p>But it's not. Perl's semantics, like English, aren't entirely regular. Some 
    built-in functions operate—to promote ease of reading—as though they were passed something 
    other than what they are actually passed. This is one of them. Similarly, when you call the 
    <span class="darkgreen">keys()</span> function, Perl doesn't evaluate the hash in a list context and pass 
    the results of that on to <span class="darkgreen">keys()</span>. The <span class="darkgreen">keys()</span> and 
    <span class="darkgreen">exists()</span> built-in functions are special in this respect; they're doing 
    things that you cannot (yet) write subroutines to do.</p>
   
   <p>The <span class="darkgreen">exists()</span> function lets us tell the difference between a hash 
    element with an undefined value, and an element that is not present in the hash 
    at all. But most uses for hashes turn out to have values that are not only defined, but 
    true, so you end up testing for the existence of a key with code like this:</p>
   
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: hash element test</div><div class="observe"><pre>
<span class="purple">if</span> ( <span class="darkred">$cost{spider}</span> )
{
  <span class="darkgreen">print</span> <span class="orange">"Arachnophobes, beware!\n"</span>;
}
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p>This test presumes that you'd never stock something with a cost of zero.</p>
   
  <H4>delete()</H4>
   
   <p>When you pass the <span class="darkgreen">delete()</span> function a hash element, Perl removes that 
    element from the hash. (If it wasn't in the hash to begin with, Perl doesn't complain.) Take a look:</p>
   
   <div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: delete()</div><div class="observe"><pre>
<span class="purple">foreach my</span> <span class="darkred">$removed</span> ( <span class="darkred">@discontinued_items</span> )    
{
  <span class="darkgreen">delete</span> <span class="darkred">$cost{$removed}</span>;
  <span class="darkgreen">delete</span> <span class="darkred">$count{$removed}</span>;
}      
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p>Once again, Perl is not evaluating the element before passing it to 
    <span class="darkgreen">delete()</span>, but instead passing the name of the hash and the value of the 
    key as distinct parameters, and using the hash element as a reader-friendly syntax.</p>
   
   <p><span class="darkgreen">delete()</span> returns the value of the element it just removed from the hash. 
    This is often useful for making code succinct.</p>
   
   <H4>values()</H4>
   
   <p>There is also a 
    <span class="darkgreen">values()</span> function. The <span class="darkgreen">values()</span> function is not quite as useful 
    as <span class="darkgreen">keys()</span> though, because values are not 
    required to be unique and you can't specify a hash element given its value. 
    Also, the order of <span class="darkgreen">values()</span> is as unpredictable as that of <span class="darkgreen">keys()</span>, 
    except in this useful situation: if you have just run <span class="darkgreen">keys()</span> and <i> have not changed the hash</i>
    before running <span class="darkgreen">values()</span>, then the order of the values will match the order 
    of the keys. </p>
      
   <div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: values()</div><div class="observe"><pre>

  <a name="s_05"></a><div id="s_05"><div class="subheading">Using Hashes</div><div class="subheadingText">
  
   <p>It's unusual to solve a problem with a Perl program without using a 
    hash somewhere in that code. There are many <i>patterns</i> of uses for 
    hashes that show up repeatedly in problem-solving. We'll describe a couple of them here.</p>
  
   <H4>Testing Set Membership</H4>
  
   <p>Often we want to know whether a given value is a member of some 
    particular set. Is a tomato a fruit or a vegetable? Is a duck-billed platypus a mammal or an amphibian? Is a 
    chickpea a chick or a pea? The hash is ideal for answering these questions because it looks up the answer 
    instantly, instead of scanning through an entire array. It reads all of the members of the set 
    into a hash at the start. (By the end of the course we'll see how to read from a file.) Here's 
    an example of this type of code:</p>
  
   <div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: Set Membership</div><div class="observe"><pre>
<span class="purple">my</span> <span class="darkred">@tree_names</span> = <span class="darkgreen">qw</span>(<span class="orange">larch pine oak birch fir palm</span>);
<span class="purple">my</span> <span class="darkred">%is_a_tree</span>;
<span class="purple">foreach my</span> <span class="darkred">$tree</span> (<span class="darkred">@tree_names</span>)
{
  <span class="darkred">$is_a_tree{$tree}</span> = <span class="orange">1</span>;
}

<span class="purple">my</span> <span class="darkred">$tree_to_test</span> = <span class="orange">'manzanita'</span>;
<span class="purple">if</span> ( <span class="darkred">$is_a_tree{$tree_to_test}</span> )
{
  <span class="darkgreen">print</span> <span class="orange">"Yup... it's a tree\n"</span>;
}
else
{
  <span class="darkgreen">print</span> <span class="orange">"Not a tree... sure it's not a bush?\n"</span>;
}
</pre></div></div>
  
<H4>Counting Occurrences</H4>
  
   <p>It's common to inquire how many times a particular string (or number, or pattern) 
    shows up in a chunk of text. Maybe you have a web server log file and you want to know how often a 
    particular client hit your server. Or you may have a text version of an e-book and want to know how 
    many times the author used the word "spiffy." Let's find out how many times the word 
    "love" occurs in the Beatles' song, "Love Me Do." Create a file called <b>word_count.pl</b>
   as shown:</p>
  
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE:</div><div class="listing"><pre><ins>#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

my $text = &lt;&lt;'END_OF_TEXT';
Love, love me do.
You know I love you,
I'll always be true,
So please, love me do.
Whoa, love me do.

Love, love me do.
You know I love you,
I'll always be true,
So please, love me do.
Whoa, love me do.

Whoa, love me do.

Love, love me do.
You know I love you,
I'll always be true,
So please, love me do.
Whoa, love me do.
Yeah, love me do.
Whoa, oh, love me do
END_OF_TEXT

my %count;  
foreach my $line ( split "\n", $text )
{
  foreach my $word ( split " ", $line )
  {
    $count{$word}++;
  }
}

print "'love' occurs $count{love} times\n";</ins>
</pre></div></div>
      
   <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it. </p>
   
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE TERMINAL SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~/perl1$ <ins>./word_count.pl</ins>
'love' occurs 18 times
cold:~/perl1$    
</pre></div></div>
    
   <p>We counted <i>all</i> of the words in the lyrics, not just "love." 
   We can postincrement (<b>++</b>) an element in the hash if the element doesn't 
    exist yet:</p>
   
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: postincrement</div><div class="observe"><pre>
<span class="darkred">$count{$word}</span><span class="darkgreen">++</span>
</pre></div></div>
  
   <p> The code above is <i>syntactic sugar</i> for: </p>

   <div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: postincrement expanded</div><div class="observe"><pre>
<span class="darkred">$count{$word}</span> = <span class="darkred">$count{$word}</span> + <span class="orange">1</span>
</pre></div></div>
  
   <p>If Perl evaluates the <span class="darkred">$count{$word}</span> on the right side of the <b>=</b> sign, and that 
    element does not yet exist in the hash, the result evaluates as the undefined value (which has 
    the name <span class="orange">undef</span>). In a <i>numeric context</i> (a subset of scalar context, forced 
    in this case by the <span class="darkgreen">+</span> sign), <span class="orange">undef</span> is zero, and so the 
    expression becomes adding zero to one to get one, and assigning that to <span class="darkred">$count{$word}</span>. 
    Normally, using <span class="orange">undef</span> in a numeric context also results in a 
    warning (if we have <span class="darkred">use warnings</span> turned on), but in the <i>specific</i> case 
    where the numeric context occurs as a result of using the <span class="darkgreen">++</span> operator, 
    that warning will <i>not</i> appear. (That design choice was made specifically so 
    that this coding idiom would work.)</p>
   
   <p>Let's improve a program from an earlier lesson.</p> 
   
   <p><img src="images/coderunner/open.gif"> Open <span class="darkred">store_report.pl</span> 
    again in CodeRunner:</p>

END_OF_REPORT

my @sold = (12, 6, -1, 24);  # One durien returned... too smelly
foreach my $line ( split "\n", $lines )
{
  my ($cost, $quantity, $item) = split " ", $line, 3;
  $quantity -= shift @sold;
  printf "%5.2f %6d %s\n", $cost, $quantity, $item;
}   
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p>You should be concerned that the array of the 
    number of fruit sold must be ordered the same way as the items in the report. That's <i>fragile</i> 
    code; it can break easily. If we were to change a line in the report to a new fruit, nothing 
    would tell us that we should also change the contents of the array <span class="darkred">@sold</span>, so the 
    output would look valid, but it would be wrong.</p>
   
   <p>We need to associate each count of fruit sold with the item it corresponds to; a 
    hash is just the way to do it. Modify <b>store_report.pl</b> as shown:</p>

   <p>Make sure you understand the logic behind these
    results. You can still use the fat comma after a string that has quotation marks around 
    it, in which case it doesn't have any effect at all, but it's still useful to be able to use the fat comma 
    to differentiate keys from values.</p>
