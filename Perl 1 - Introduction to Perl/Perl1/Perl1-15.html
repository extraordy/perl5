  <p>In this lesson, we'll focus on the sorting. Many of the programs we wrote in earlier lessons would have been 
   better if they had incorporated sorting. Take for example, the output of the 
   <span class="darkgreen">keys()</span> function. Previously, when we iterated through a 
   hash, the output was indeterminate. But we can incorporate
   predictability and repeatability into the order of 
   iteration, using a sorted version of 
   the output from <span class="darkgreen">keys()</span>.</p>
  
 <a name="h_01"></a><div class="heading">sort()</div><div class="headingText">
   
   <p>Sorting is a task that helped define computer engineering, back when computer programmers were obsessed 
   with sorting algorithms and 
    code, and computers looked like this:</p>
   
   
   <p><div class="c"><img src="images/computers.jpg"></div></p>
   
   <p>Computers were so underpowered back then that in order to sort even modest amounts of 
    data, careful attention had to be paid to the method used, to make sure that 
   a task could be completed.</p>
   
   <p>These days, only a few people are still obsessed with improving sorting mechanisms; the 
    rest of us just call the functions that have already been written. The <span class="darkgreen">sort()</span> 
    function in Perl has been updated over the years to improve its performance, but you don't 
    need to know what goes on inside of it in order to use it. In general, the <span class="darkgreen">sort()</span> function 
    works like this:</p>
   
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: sort</div><div class="observe"><pre>
<i>SORTED_LIST</i> = <span class="darkgreen">sort</span> <i>UNSORTED_LIST</i>
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p>There you are. Not so very complicated, right?  Now, let's work on an example. Create a new 
   file called <b>sort.pl</b> as shown here:</p>
   
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE:</div><div class="listing"><pre><ins>#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

my @inventory = qw(pears bananas peaches apples cherries oranges lemons grapefruit);
foreach my $fruit ( sort @inventory )
{
  print "$fruit\n";
}</ins>
</pre></div></div>

  <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it. </p>
  
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE TERMINAL SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~$ <ins>cd perl1</ins>
cold:~/perl1$ <ins>./sort.pl</ins>

cold:~/perl1$    
</pre></div></div>

   <p>The <i>input</i> to the <span class="darkgreen">sort()</span> function is the array <span class="darkred">@inventory</span>. When the 
    argument list for <span class="darkgreen">sort()</span> is that straightforward, we usually omit the 
    parentheses—we can omit parentheses around function arguments <b>if</b> 
    precedence leads Perl to correctly identify the location of the end of the argument list. 
    It's common practice is to omit parentheses around the arguments to many built-in 
    functions.</p>
    
   <p>The <i>output</i> from the <span class="darkgreen">sort()</span> function is the list that results 
    from sorting <span class="darkred">@inventory</span>. Rather than store that output in another array, I'm 
    using it as the list in a <span class="purple">foreach</span> statement. </p>
   
   <p>Let's modify that output, starting with the addition of some uppercase letters:</p>
   
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE: sort.pl</div><div class="listing"><pre>#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

<ins>my @inventory = qw(pears bananas Peaches apples Cherries oranges lemons Grapefruit);</ins>
foreach my $fruit ( sort @inventory )
{
  print "$fruit\n";
}
</pre></div></div>
   
  <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it. </p>
  
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE TERMINAL SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~/perl1$ <ins>./sort.pl</ins>
Cherries
Grapefruit
Peaches
apples
bananas
lemons
oranges
pears   
cold:~/perl1$    
</pre></div></div>

   <p>The sorting order in Perl is called "ASCIIbetical", meaning that it is not quite
    alphabetical—as you see by the output you just generated—but instead, it's determined by the
    <i>ASCII collating sequence</i>. ASCII is the <b>A</b>merican <b>S</b>tandard <b>C</b>ode
    for <b>I</b>nformation <b>I</b>nterchange, and it's the basis for how characters are stored
    in computers. (ASCII has been replaced in large part by Unicode, but the
    transition is still a work in progress and character encoding issues beyond 7-bit
    ASCII are outside the scope of this course.)</p>
   
   <p>The output in our example is in this particular order, because capital letters come before
    lowercase letters in ASCII. Here are 7-bit printable characters ordered left-to-right by
    their position in the ASCII collating sequence:</p>
   
  <p><div class="c"><b>!"#$%&amp;'()*+,-./0123456789:;&lt;=&gt;?@ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ[\]^_`abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz{|}~</b></div></p>
   
   <p>Lots of <i>non</i>printable characters are part of that sequence as well. You can find 
    out more by typing "man ascii" at the command prompt on a Unix/Linux computer, or by
    Googling "ASCII."</p>
   
   <p>In a moment we'll go over the way to sort that list without regard to the case of the 
    letters. But first, let's look at a few functions. Create 
    a new file called <b>sort_numeric.pl</b> as shown:</p>
   
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE:</div><div class="listing"><pre><ins>#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

my @numbers;
foreach my $x ( 1 .. 10 )
{
  push @numbers, int(rand 1000);
}
foreach my $number ( sort @numbers )
{
  print "$number\n";
}</ins>
</pre></div></div>
   
  <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it. </p>
  
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE TERMINAL SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~/perl1$ <ins>./sort_numeric.pl</ins>

cold:~/perl1$    
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p>We have some new functions in this example:</p>
   
   <ul><li><span class="darkgreen">rand</span>(<span class="orange"><i>N</i></span>), which produces a random floating 
     point number greater than or equal to 0, and less than <i>N</i> (that is, the result may 
     be exactly 0, but will never be exactly <i>N</i>. If you omit <i>N</i>, it uses 
     <span class="orange">1</span> by default).
    </li><li><span class="darkgreen">int()</span>, which returns the integer part of its argument (truncates 
     towards zero).</li></ul>
   
   <p>So <span class="darkgreen">int</span>(<span class="darkgreen">rand(</span><span class="orange">1000</span><span class="darkgreen">)</span>) returns 
    a random integer between 0 and 999.</p>
   
   <p>Each time you run that program, you should get different output. Run it as many times as 
    you need to until the output includes a number that isn't three digits long. Where is it in 
    the sorted output? Is that where you think it should be?</p>
   
   <p>The number is where it <i>should</i> be—Perl doesn't make mistakes—but you 
    may have had different expectations. That number comes out there 
    because of ASCIIbetical sorting, which treats every element as a string. That means that 
    "123" sorts before "35" just the same as "abc" sorts before "de." If you want to sort 
    numerically, then you have to tell Perl to treat the elements of the 
    <span class="darkgreen">sort</span> input list as numbers, not strings.</p>
   
   <p>We do that by adding a special argument to <span class="darkgreen">sort()</span>. It's
    special because <span class="darkgreen">sort()</span> already takes a list as its
    input argument, so there's no room for another argument—if another argument was added, it would
    look like part of the list to be sorted. There's a special syntax for this
    special argument; it looks like this:</p>
   
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE:</div><div class="observe"><pre>
<i>SORTED_LIST</i> = <span class="darkgreen">sort</span> { <span class="darkred">$a</span> &lt;=&gt; <span class="darkred">$b</span> } <i>UNSORTED_LIST</i>
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p>That's right, the argument appears within curly brackets between 
    <span class="darkgreen">sort</span> and the input list. And what's inside those brackets must be 
    <i>exactly</i> what's written above. Modify <b>sort_numeric.pl</b> as shown:</p>

<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO EDIT:</div><div class="listing"><pre>#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

my @numbers;
foreach my $x ( 1 .. 10 )
{
  push @numbers, int(rand 1000);
}
<ins>foreach my $number ( sort { $a &lt;=&gt; $b } @numbers ) </ins>
{
  print "$number\n";
}
</pre></div></div>
   
  <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it. Your
  output will look something like this:</p>
  
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE TERMINAL SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~/perl1$ <ins>./sort_numeric.pl</ins>

   <p>So that's how you sort numbers. (Want to break it? You 
    know you do! Try putting something non-numeric in the input list to 
    <span class="darkgreen">sort()</span> when it has that special argument and see what happens.)</p>
   
   <p>Now, this bit of information might satisfy a lesser scholar, but not you! 
   You want to <i>understand</i> what's going on in detail. So let's dig a little deeper into that special argument.</p>
   
   <p>Between those curly brackets is what's called a <i>comparison function</i>. In general, it 
    looks like this:</p>
  
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE:</div><div class="observe"><pre>
<i>SORTED_LIST</i> = <span class="darkgreen">sort</span> { <i>COMPARISON</i> } <i>UNSORTED_LIST</i>
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p>When Perl sorts a list, deep down inside the clever algorithm that does the sorting, it 
    compares a pair of elements in the list, many times over, for different pairs of elements. 
    Perl wants to determine whether those two elements are equal, 
    and if not, whether the first one is "less than" or "greater than" the other. Armed with 
    that information, the clever algorithm decides how to order those two elements in the 
    sorted output list it is building.</p>
   
  <p>The <b>&lt;=&gt;</b> operator (affectionately known as the "spaceship operator"—think "Star 
    Wars") is the basic building block of the numeric comparison function. It returns -1 if the 
    argument on its left is less than the argument on its right, 0 if the arguments are equal, 
    or 1 if the argument on the left is greater than the argument on the right.</p>
   
   <p>There is a <i>default</i> comparison function. If you don't supply one—if you just say 
    <span class="darkgreen">sort</span>( <span class="darkred">@list</span> )—then it is as if you
    had written this:</p>
   
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: default comparison</div><div class="observe"><pre>
<span class="darkgreen">sort</span> { <span class="darkred">$a</span> <span class="darkgreen">cmp</span> <span class="darkred">$b</span> } <i>UNSORTED_LIST</i> 
</pre></div></div>
   
  <p>That <span class="darkgreen">cmp</span> operator is to strings what the <b>&lt;=&gt;</b> operator is to 
    numbers: it returns -1 if the string on its left is less than (like using the 
    <b>lt</b> operator) the string on its right, 0 if the strings are equal, 
    or 1 if the string on its left is greater than (like using the <b>gt</b>
    operator) the string on its right). By the way, you'll almost never see <b>cmp</b> or <b>&lt;=&gt;</b>
    used outside of sorting comparison functions. </p>
    
    <p>Now, what are <span class="darkred">$a</span> and 
    <span class="darkred">$b</span>?</p>
   
   <p>They're the two elements from the input list need to be compared by Perl's internal
    sorting algorithm! (We engineers call this comparison function
    a <i>callback</i>.) When Perl is ready to compare two elements in the list, it sets 
    <span class="darkred">$a</span> and <span class="darkred">$b</span> to those elements, and calls your comparison function
    (the code between the curly brackets). Perl reads the result, and depending on whether the
    answer is less than, equal to, or greater than, zero, it determines the way that pair of elements
    should be ordered.</p>
   
   <p>This diagram shows you what's going on:</p>
   
   <p><div class="c"><img src="images/sort.png"></div></p>
  
  <a name="s_01"></a><div id="s_01"><div class="subheading">Custom Sorting Orders</div><div class="subheadingText">
   
   <p>If ASCIIbetical and numeric were the only two ways of sorting lists, we wouldn't have
    bothered to learn about the comparison function. But there is an <i>infinite</i>
    number of possible comparison functions! You can write them to sort any way you want.
    Let's say, for example, that you want to sort strings without regard to their case; in other words,
    make "apples" sort before "Peaches". Go ahead and modify the code in <b>sort.pl</b> as shown:</p>
   
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE:</div><div class="listing"><pre>#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

my @inventory = qw(pears bananas Peaches apples Cherries oranges lemons Grapefruit);
<ins>@inventory = sort { lc($a) cmp lc($b) } @inventory;
foreach my $fruit ( @inventory )</ins>
{
  print "$fruit\n";
}
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it. </p>
   
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE TERMINAL SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~/perl1$ <ins>./sort.pl</ins>
apples
bananas
Cherries
Grapefruit
lemons
oranges
Peaches
pears    
cold:~/perl1$    
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p>The comparison function puts every argument that it's passed into lowercase; so when it is passed
    "Peaches" and "bananas", it will return the result of  <span class="orange">"peaches"</span> 
    <span class="darkgreen">cmp</span> <span class="orange">"bananas"</span> (note that "peaches" is now in
    lowercase). Now Perl's sort function knows that "bananas" goes before 
    "Peaches" when sorted. Give it a try!</p>
   
   <p>I deliberately sorted <span class="darkred">@inventory</span> in place to show you that it could be done;
    there are no issues with putting the results into the same array as the original input is located.</p>
   
   <p>More advanced sorting functions can figure out how to arrange dates typed in this format "29/08/2009" 
    into something that can be sorted: </p>
   
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: Date Sorting</div><div class="observe"><pre>
<span class="darkgreen">sort</span> { <span class="darkblue">date_to_num</span>( <span class="darkred">$a</span> ) &lt;=&gt; <span class="darkblue">date_to_num</span>( <span class="darkred">$b</span> ) } ...
<span class="purple">sub</span> <span class="darkblue">date_to_num</span>
{
  <span class="purple">my</span> <span class="darkred">$date</span>  = <span class="darkgreen">shift</span>;
    
  <span class="purple">my</span> <span class="darkred">$day</span>   = <span class="darkgreen">substr</span> <span class="darkred">$date</span>, 0, 2;
  <span class="purple">my</span> <span class="darkred">$month</span> = <span class="darkgreen">substr</span> <span class="darkred">$date</span>, 3, 2;
  <span class="purple">my</span> <span class="darkred">$year</span>  = <span class="darkgreen">substr</span> <span class="darkred">$date</span>, 6, 4;
    
  <span class="purple">return</span> "<span class="darkred">$year$month$day</span>";
}
</pre></div></div> 
   
   <p>Even though we concatenated strings together into another string to be returned from 
    <span class="darkblue">date_to_str</span>, Perl was still able to sort the result numerically because the strings
    looked like numbers. However, since the strings are all of the same length, string
    sorting would have worked equally well (until the year 10,000).</p> 
   
   <p>(You may remember <span class="darkgreen">substr()</span> from the homework for lesson 10!)</p>
    
   <p>Every comparison function ends up constructing either two numbers compared with 
    <b>&lt;=&gt;</b> or two strings compared with <b>cmp</b>.</p>

    before manipulating them. (I know, the data in this case isn't really "external,"
    since it comes from strings inside the program, but we're going to learn
    how to get data from outside the program in the next lesson!)</li><li>Don't bother sorting the keys of <span class="darkred">%sold</span> when processing the sales. It 
    wouldn't make any difference, because there is no output from this phase.</li><li><i>Do</i> sort the key of <span class="darkred">%item_cost</span>, because output is being produced, and it's 
    good practice to produce that output in a 
    predictable order.</li><li>We didn't apply case-insensitive sorting because we assume that the input data will be 
    consistent with respect to the use of capital letters. Feel free to change this!</li><li>In this program <span class="darkred">%inventory</span> and <span class="darkred">%item_cost</span> must contain the 
    same keys. The way that it is structured, this is guaranteed.</li></ul>
