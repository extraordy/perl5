      <h2>Formatted Printing and More Looping - Quiz 1</h2> 
      
      
      
      
      <p>What is the difference between the following code examples?</p>
      
      
      <div class="observeBox">
         <div class="observeTitle">Observe:</div>
         <div class="observe"><pre>while (my $x = shift @a )</pre></div>
      </div>
      
      
      <p>and</p>
      
      
      <div class="observeBox">
         <div class="observeTitle">Observe:</div>
         <div class="observe"><pre>foreach my $x ( @a )</pre></div>
      </div>
      
      
      <p><b>Hint:</b> to test this, create and run a small program. After executing each loop, print the contents of the array.</p>
      
        
      
      
      <p>The while example will likely result in an empty array when complete, because it removes values as it goes. The foreach 
         example does not suffer this side effect.
      </p>
      
      
      <p><b>Note:</b> It is possible to still have values in @a if one of them is considered false, because the while will stop at the 
         first false value, though this is often the undef at the 'end' of an array.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Often students will say that there is no difference between these two examples because both allow access to each value of
         the 
         array individually. Instruct them that while this is true, there are side effects of the loop that are different.
      </p>
      
      
      <p><b>Grading Criteria:</b> Student should demonstrate understanding of loop constructs and shift.</p>
