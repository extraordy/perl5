      <h2>Formatted Printing and More Looping - Quiz 2</h2> 
      
      
      
      
      <p>Is a fixed-length field appropriate for printing the following data types? Justify your answer:</p>
      
      
      <ul>
         <li>A person's last name</li>
         <li>A telephone number</li>
         <li>An airline flight number</li>
      </ul>
      
        
      
      
      <p>There is not a single correct answer; one should suggest that a flight number and/or telephone number might make a good candidate,
         but the focus here is for them to justify their answer.
      </p>
      
      
      <p><b>Grading Criteria:</b> Student should show understanding of fixed length fields.</p>
