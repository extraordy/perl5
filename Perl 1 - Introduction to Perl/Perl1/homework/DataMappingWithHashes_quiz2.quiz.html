      <h2>Data Mapping with Hashes - Quiz 2</h2> 
      
      
      
      
      <p>How many times did the code in the lesson report that the word "love" appeared in the Beatles' song?</p>
      
      
      <p>Count them by hand. Did you get the same number?</p>
      
      
      <p>What function would you use to make sure that you counted every occurrence of "love" regardless of case?</p>
      
        
      
      
      <p>Code found 18; hand count is 24 due to case and commas ('Love,' nq 'love').</p>
      
      
      <p>lc or uc can be used to alter the case of the string. substr can be used to trim a string down to just 4 characters 
         (getting rid of the ',' in 'Love,'. Remember, we have not covered regex yet.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Alternate answer: This code doesn't exclude commas when splitting strings, so "love," isn't included in the matches, so 18
         
         unless you count 'Love' as well or include commas, then 20 or 24 is OK.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>To make sure to count every occurrence of "love" regardless of case, you'd use lc() or uc().</p>
      
      
      <p>Some students ask about how to get rid of the punctuation and get an accurate count. While there are very brief and concise
         
         ways to do this at an advanced level, there is one procedure that you can present using the functions already introduced:
      </p> 
      
      
      <div class="observeBox">
         <div class="observeTitle">Observe:</div>
         <div class="observe"><pre>my $text = '....';
my (@words) = split /\W+/, lc $text;
my %count;
for my $word ( @words ) {
$count{$word}++ ;
}</pre></div>
      </div>
      
      
      <p><b>Grading Criteria:</b> Student should demonstrate understating of existing string manipulation functions.</p>
