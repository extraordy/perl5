      <h2>Data Mapping with Hashes - Quiz 1</h2> 
      
      
      
      
      <p>In what order is the result of the keys() function?</p>
      
        
      
      
      <p>Unreliable, inconsistent, unordered, none. Any of these will work.</p>
      
      
      <p>Long form answer: It's not an order that will make any sense to you, it isn't useful for anything, and it can change without
         
         warning.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>The point that the hash won't be in a particular order can't be tested easily by students because it has to do with a number
         
         of factors as written about in perldoc -f keys, perldoc perlsec, and perldoc perlrun.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>The ordering of a hash is only changed if it looks like there's a possible attack occurring and most hashes won't be accessed
         
         to the extent to actually show this.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>In order for the student to see that the hash ordering is indeed random, you can direct them to use the 
         <b>PERL_HASH_SEED_DEBUG</b> environment variable when running their program.
      </p>
      
      
      <p><b>Grading Criteria:</b> Student should demonstrate understanding of hashes and the underlying storage of information.</p>
