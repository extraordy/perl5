      <h2>Properties - Quiz 1</h2> 
      
      
      
      
      <p>John Q. Programmer wanted to print out a line with three strings separated by asterisks, and so he wrote:</p>
      
      
      <div class="observeBox">
         <div class="observeTitle">Observe:</div>
         <div class="observe"><pre>print join '*', 'a', 'b', 'c', "\n";</pre></div>
      </div>
      
      
      <p>What's wrong with that code and how would you fix it?</p>
      
        
      
      
      <p>The reason this is an "error" is that the developer probably did not want <b>a*b*c*\n</b>; rather they wanted 
         <b>a*b*c\n</b> (without the extra * between c and \n).
      </p>
      
      
      <div class="observeBox">
         <div class="observeTitle">Observe:</div>
         <div class="observe"><pre>print join('*', 'a', 'b', 'c'), "\n";</pre></div>
      </div>
      
      
      <p>If the student has split up the list by saving off $string as the join of a,b,c and then prints "$string\n", inform them that
         
         while this does address the issue there is a simpler way that only requires the use of two additional characters in the 
         example code.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Note that this will not work: print (join '*', 'a', 'b', 'c'), "\n";</p>
      
      
      <p><b>Grading Criteria:</b> Student should demonstrate knowledge of the join statement.</p>
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>In the statement:</p>
      
      
      <div class="observeBox">
         <div class="observeTitle">Observe:</div>
         <div class="observe"><pre>($x, $y, $z) = (1, 2);</pre></div>
      </div>
      
      
      <p>What does <b>$z</b> get set to?</p>
      
      
      
      
      <div class="observeBox">
         <div class="observeTitle">Observe:</div>
         <div class="observe"><pre>undef</pre></div>
      </div>
      
      
      <p>Other common answers that define the same concept are: Uninitialized, Null, and Nil. If these are given, tell the student
         
         that they are correct but in Perl we call this concept undef.
      </p>
      
      
      <p><b>Grading Criteria:</b> Student should demonstrate understanding of how an empty value in a list is handled.</p>
