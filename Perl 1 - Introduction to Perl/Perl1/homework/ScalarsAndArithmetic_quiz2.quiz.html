      <h2>Scalars and Arithmetic - Quiz 2</h2> 
      
      
      
      
      <p>Create a new perl script with the following code:</p>
      
      
      <div class="listingBox">
         <div class="listingTitle">Type this in the editor below:</div>
         <div class="listing"><pre> my $x = (.0425 * 2) + .0025;
 print $x - (.0425 * 2) - .0025;
</pre></div>
      </div> 
      
      
      <p>Run your script. What answer do you get?</p>
      
      
      <p>Explain why the answer is not zero.</p>
      
        
      
      
      <p>2.16840434497101e-18 due to floating point precision rounding errors.</p>
      
      
      <p>Note: There is some possibility that the answer will change depending on the platform that the code is run on, but this is
         
         the answer that the student will get when they run the program on our platform.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>The reason is due to rounding errors and the limited precision of floating point numbers as stored by computers. The point
         of 
         this question is not for the student to understand exactly how this happens and the structure of floating point storage and
         
         calculations, but to understand that it does happen, because it is a source of frequent frustration in Perl and all languages.
         
         Any answer that includes the terms "rounding" and "precision" is likely to be correct.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>An answer that refers to improper use of () or precedence may indicate the student has altered the given code. This answer
         
         should be considered incorrect; ask the student to run the code as is and explain why the answer that it does result in is
         
         not zero, and instead is a very very small number that approaches zero.
      </p> 
      
      
      <p><b>Grading Criteria:</b> Student should show they recognize floating point errors.</p>
