  <p>Now that we've built a solid foundation, we're ready to refine our understanding of aggregates (arrays and 
   hashes). By the time we finish this lesson, 
   you'll be confident in your ability to use arrays and hashes, and 
   pass them to and from subroutines using the command line. </p>
  
  <a name="s_01"></a><div id="s_01"><div class="subheading">Command Line Arguments</div><div class="subheadingText">
   
   <p>Retrieving arguments from the command line is pretty straightforward. They
    arrive into your program in the special array <span class="darkred">@ARGV</span>. 
    A command line 
    argument is anything you type on the command line after the name of your Perl program.
    If you've made the program executable and refer to it directly with a command such as:</p>
   
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: argumentless command</div><div class="observe"><pre>
<span class="darkred"><b>./terraform.pl</b></span>
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p>...then the arguments follow <span class="darkred">terraform.pl</span>, and are separated by spaces:</p>
   
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: command with arguments</div><div class="observe"><pre>
<b><span class="darkred">./terraform.pl</span></b> -d --jovian "Phase 2 of Invasion Plan" Ganymede Callisto
</pre></div></div> 
   
   <p>If you invoke the program by calling perl, your command line will look similar:</p>
   
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: command with arguments</div><div class="observe"><pre>
perl <b><span class="darkred">terraform.pl</span></b> -d --jovian "Phase 2 of Invasion Plan" Ganymede Callisto
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p>The rules for forming command line arguments
    are <i>not defined by Perl</i>; they're defined by the command shell 
    you're using, and the program that interprets what you type and subsequently prints the 
    prompt string. When you press 
    <b>Enter</b>, that shell interprets the line you typed according to its particular rules for processing, 
    and then determines which information it will give to Perl. </p>
   
   <p>Most programs refer to arguments that begin with hyphens (like <b>-d</b>
    and <b>--jovian</b> as we saw in our example) or slashes, as <b>options</b>
    or <b>flags</b> and treat them differently. But to the shell, and to Perl, they are regular command line
    arguments.</p>
   
   <p>White space (spaces or tabs) separates each command line argument and indicates to the shell
   where one argument ends and another one begins. If you want to enter an
    argument that contains white space, then you need to surround it with quotation marks,
    like <b>"Phase 2 of Invasion Plan"</b> above.  Most shells accept either single or
    double quotation marks for this purpose.</p>
   
   <p>Alright. Let's give this a try! We'll write a program that does nothing but report on the command line 
    arguments. Create a file called <b>terraform.pl</b> as shown:</p>
   
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE: terraform.pl</div><div class="listing"><pre><ins>#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

my $count = 0;
foreach my $argument ( @ARGV )
{
  print '$ARGV[', $count++, '] = ', $argument, "\n";
}</ins>
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it without any 
    arguments. Then run it with one argument, and then run it again with three arguments.  Try putting quotation marks around an 
    argument containing white space to see how that works. Start a terminal session and type these commands:</p>
    
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE TERMINAL SESSION</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~$ <ins>cd perl1</ins>
cold:~/perl1$ <ins>./terraform.pl</ins>
cold:~/perl1$ <ins>./terraform.pl test</ins>
$ARGV[0] = test
cold:~/perl1$ <ins>./terraform.pl test test2 test3</ins>
$ARGV[0] = test
$ARGV[1] = test2
$ARGV[2] = test3
cold:~/perl1$ <ins>./terraform.pl test "test2 test3"</ins>
$ARGV[0] = test
$ARGV[1] = test2 test3
cold:~/perl1$
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p>Our command shell parses metacharacters—as most of them do—so try passing some metacharacters in 
   command arguments to see what the shell does with them before Perl sees the arguments. An 
   argument consisting of the asterisk character (<b>*</b>) usually expands to the names of all of the files in the current 
   directory; that's a good metacharacter to try!</p>
   
   <p>The array <span class="darkred">@ARGV</span> is special to Perl, so you don't declare it with
    <span class="purple">my</span>—it doesn't belong to you, it belongs to Perl.</p>
   
   <p>One more thing—remember how <span class="darkgreen">shift()</span> inside a subroutine defaults 
    to shifting <span class="darkred">@_</span>, the array of subroutine arguments? Well, <i>outside</i> of subroutines, array 
    <span class="darkgreen">shift()</span> defaults to <span class="darkred">@ARGV</span>! (By the way, if you're a C
    programmer and you're wondering what happened to the name of the program, it's in 
    <span class="darkred">$0</span>.)</p>
  
  </div></div>
  <a name="s_02"></a><div id="s_02"><div class="subheading">Passing Arrays To and From Subroutines</div><div class="subheadingText">
   
   <p>Passing arguments to a subroutine is like putting various sticks through a wood chipper—everything that 
   comes out the other end looks the same. Whether you pass 
    scalars, arrays, or hashes, everything gets flattened into a list on the way in and put 
    into an array (<span class="darkred">@_</span>).</p>
   
   <p>An array in a list context expands to the list of the
    elements in the array.  Passing arguments to a subroutine imposes list context.</p>
   
   <p>Here's an example to illustrate these points. Create a file called <b>interleave.pl</b> 
    as shown:</p>
   
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE: interleave.pl</div><div class="listing"><pre><ins>#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

my @first = qw(Can unlock secret);
my @second = qw(you the code?);

my @mixed = interleave_words( scalar(@first), @first, @second );
print "Result: @mixed\n";

sub interleave_words
{
  my @results;
  
  my $count = shift;
  foreach my $index ( 0 .. $count-1 )
  {
    $results[$index * 2] = shift;
  }
  if ( @_ != $count )
  {
    die "Second array not same size ($count) as the first\n";
  }
  foreach my $index ( 0 .. $count-1 )
  {
    $results[$index * 2 + 1] = shift;
  }

  return @results;
}</ins>
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it.</p>
   
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE TERMINAL SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~/perl1$ <ins>./interleave.pl</ins>
Result: Can you unlock the secret code?
cold:~/perl1$
</pre></div></div>

   <p>The subroutine <span class="darkblue">interleave_words</span> has been written so that it will interleave 
    the contents of any two arrays that are passed to it. Its first argument is the number of 
    entries in the first array. Why do we do that? After all, doesn't Perl know how many 
    elements there are in an array? </p>
   
   <p>Yes, Perl does know that, but when we pass an array to a subroutine, its identity as an 
    array is lost. Its contents are copied into a list of all the subroutine arguments, which 
    are flattened together into one big long list. (Technically, the contents are not copied but 
    <i>aliased</i>, meaning that you could modify them, but as I said before, that's not a good 
    idea, so don't try.)</p>
   
   <p>So, if you pass two arrays to a subroutine, the subroutine can't tell where one array's 
    contents end and the next begin, unless we provide that information, by passing the size of 
    the first array as the very first argument. (This particular subroutine was intended to have two 
    arrays of equal size passed to it. Using a dividing line set halfway through <span class="darkred">@_</span>, 
    it could be written under the assumption that it will always be called correctly, 
    but this leaves no 
    margin for error.)</p>
   
   <p>The <span class="darkgreen">scalar()</span> function puts its argument into
    scalar context, so by calling <span class="darkgreen">scalar()</span> on an array, we are guaranteed to 
    retrieve the size of the array being called. </p>
   
   <p>The result returned from <span class="darkblue">interleave_words</span> is an array, which is evaluated
    in list context because it is being assigned to an array (<span class="darkred">@mixed</span>), and so
    results in a copy of the array that was <span class="darkred">@results</span> inside the subroutine. Context 
    propagates into subroutines, which is an elegant way of saying that if you want to figure out 
    the context, just imagine that the subroutine call was replaced with whatever follows the 
    word <span class="purple">return</span> in the subroutine. In this case we have:</p>
   
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: subroutine context propagation</div><div class="observe"><pre>
<span class="purple">my</span> <span class="darkred">@mixed</span> = <span class="darkblue">interleave_words (...</span>
.
.
.
  <span class="purple">return</span> <span class="darkred">@results</span>;
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p>...and so—for the purposes of determining context—imagine that it was saying this 
    instead:</p>
   
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: subroutine context propagation</div><div class="observe"><pre>
<span class="purple">my</span> <span class="darkred">@mixed</span> = <span class="darkred">@results</span>;
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p>This little trick will save you much time and trouble. If what follows the 
    <span class="purple">return</span> statement is a call to another subroutine, you can keep going 
    deeper.</p>
 
  </div></div>
  <a name="s_03"></a><div id="s_03"><div class="subheading">Passing Hashes To and From Subroutines</div><div class="subheadingText">
   
   <p>So, what does a hash evaluate as in list context? </p>
   
   <p>It evaluates as a list of key-value pairs, identical to a list that could
    have been used to initialize the hash to its current state. Each pair consists of two elements in
    the list, the key followed by the value. The order of the pairs is uncertain, but each 
    value follows its corresponding key in the list.</p>
   
   <p>That allows us to understand how copying a hash works. When you have code that looks like this: </p>
   
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: hash copying</div><div class="observe"><pre>
<span class="purple">my</span> <span class="darkred">%copy</span> = <span class="darkred">%original</span>;
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p>...the information on the right side of the equals sign (<b>=</b>) is placed in list context and 
    evaluates to a list of key-value pairs that is then assigned to the left side of the equals sign (<b>=</b>). 
    Previously, you might have looked at that statement and assumed that it resulted in 
    a copy because that's what it looks like, but now you know how it works!</p>
   
   <p>Armed with this knowledge, we can use the subroutine <span class="darkblue">interleave_words</span> to
    perform an entirely different task—creating a hash, given an array of its keys and 
    another array of its values—<i>without changing</i> the subroutine definition at all! This 
    is the sort of thing that makes strictly typed languages insanely jealous. Copy 
    <span class="darkred">interleave.pl</span> to <span class="darkred">make_hash.pl</span> and edit it as 
    shown:</p>
   
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE: make_hash.pl</div><div class="listing"><pre>#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;
<ins>
my @keys   = qw(tetra hexa octa dodeca icosa);
my @values = (4, 6, 8, 12, 20);

foreach my $key ( @keys )
{
  $key .= 'hedron';
}
my %faces = interleave_words( scalar(@keys), @keys, @values );
foreach my $solid ( keys %faces )
{
  print "A(n) $solid has $faces{$solid} faces\n";
}
</ins>
sub interleave_words
{
  my @results;
  
  my $count = shift;
  foreach my $index ( 0 .. $count-1 )
  {
    $results[$index * 2] = shift;
  }
  if ( @_ != $count )
  {
    die "Second array not same size ($count) as the first\n";
  }
  foreach my $index ( 0 .. $count-1 )
  {
    $results[$index * 2 + 1] = shift;
  }

  return @results;
}
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it.</p>
   
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE TERMINAL SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~/perl1$ <ins>./make_hash.pl</ins>
A(n) tetrahedron has 4 faces
A(n) dodecahedron has 12 faces
A(n) icosahedron has 20 faces
A(n) octahedron has 8 faces
A(n) hexahedron has 6 faces
cold:~/perl1$    
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p>Hashes do not interpolate in 
    double-quoted strings. We print the contents of this 
    hash with the usual kind of iterative loop.</p>
   
   <p>When I ran this program, it printed the results in this order: 4, 12, 20, 8, 6. What order 
    did your program print them in?</p>
   
   <p>Notice that rather than type the "hedron" suffix many times, I employed a 
    short loop to add it in. In this case, it ended up taking more room than it would have just 
    to type in the longer words, but in a later course you'll find out how to add a suffix like 
    this in just a few words. Right now, we want to get used to the idea of eliminating 
    duplication.</p>
    
   <p>And the <span class="darkred">$key</span> in that 
    loop is an <i>alias</i> for each member of the <span class="darkred">@keys</span> array: that is, another 
    name for each element of the array in turn. If it were a <i>copy</i> of the element, then 
    the original array elements would not have <span class="orange">"hedron"</span> concatenated to them. 
    This aliasing feature is useful for allowing us to modify arrays like we did here, but be 
    careful not to change the loop element of a <span class="purple">foreach</span> loop by accident, or 
    you'll overwrite whatever it's aliased to!</p>
   
   <p>Returning a hash from a subroutine isn't too complicated—subroutines return 
    lists, and you assign that list to a hash when you call the subroutine.</p>
   
   <H4>Passing Named Arguments to Subroutines</H4>
   
   <p>When a subroutine takes more than a couple of arguments, it becomes more challenging to remember the order in which 
   they should be passed. It also becomes more difficult to handle the cases where one or more
    arguments are optional. Now, Perl doesn't have named parameter passing, but we can pretend
    that it does by using the fat comma and a hash. Here's how that works:</p>
   
   <p><b>Step One:</b> when calling the subroutine, precede each argument with a name and a fat 
    comma. For example: </p>
   
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE:</div><div class="observe"><pre>
<span class="purple">my</span> <span class="darkred">$burger_cost</span> = <span class="darkblue">prepare_burger</span>( <span class="orange">patties</span> <span class="darkgreen">=&gt;</span> <span class="orange">2</span>,
                                  <span class="orange">condiment</span> <span class="darkgreen">=&gt;</span> <span class="orange">'mustard'</span>,
                                  <span class="orange">buns</span> <span class="darkgreen">=&gt;</span> <span class="orange">'wheat'</span>,
                                  <span class="orange">tomato</span> <span class="darkgreen">=&gt;</span> <span class="orange">1</span> );
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p><b>Step Two:</b> when defining the subroutine, copy the arguments into a hash:</p>
   
   <div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE:</div><div class="observe"><pre>
<span class="purple">sub</span> <span class="darkblue">prepare_burger</span>
{
  <span class="purple">my</span> <span class="darkred">%arg</span> = <span class="darkred">@_</span>;
  # ...
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p>Now you can access the arguments as hash entries whose keys are the names of the 
    arguments:</p>
   
   <div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE:</div><div class="observe"><pre>
  # ... continuing the subroutine definition...
  <span class="purple">my</span> <span class="darkred">$cost</span> = <span class="orange">0</span>;
  <span class="purple">if</span> ( <span class="darkred">$arg{tomato}</span> ) 
  {
    <span class="darkred">$cost</span> <span class="darkgreen">+=</span> <span class="darkred">$tomato_slice_cost</span>;
  }
  <span class="darkred">$cost</span> <span class="darkgreen">+=</span> <span class="darkred">patty_cost</span> <span class="darkgreen">*</span> <span class="darkred">$arg{patties}</span>;
  # ...   
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p>The order in which we pass arguments to the subroutine makes no difference; their names 
    tell us where they are. And, if we want to leave out an optional argument when calling the
    subroutine, we can tell that from within the subroutine by testing for the existence of the
    hash element with the argument's name.</p>
   
   <p>To impose rules on the way your subroutine gets called, you can 
    test for compliance by looking at the elements of the hash you copy <span class="darkred">@_</span> into. 
    If the rules are not followed, then you can have the subroutine <span class="darkgreen">die()</span>.</p>
