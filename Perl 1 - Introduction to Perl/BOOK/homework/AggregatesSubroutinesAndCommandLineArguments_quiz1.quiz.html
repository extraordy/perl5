      <h2>Aggregates, Subroutines, and Command-Line Arguments - Quiz 1</h2> 
      
      
      
      
      <p>What is an advantage of passing subroutine arguments via a list that looks like a hash initialization?</p>
      
        
      
      
      <p>Allows for both named parameters and optional parameters to be passed to a function. Also it is nice that order is less relevant.</p>
      
      
      <p><b>Grading Criteria:</b> Student should demonstrate understanding of the advantage of using a hash as a way to pass information to a subroutine.</p>
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>What happens if you pass an odd number of arguments to a subroutine that assigns <b>@_</b>&nbsp;to a hash?</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>Code will produce a warning and the "last" key's value will be undef.</p>
      
      
      <p><b>Grading Criteria:</b> Student should demonstrate understanding of how hashes are assigned, as well as any limitations due to errors.</p>
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>What happens if a subroutine returns a list containing an odd number of elements to a caller that assigns those results to
         a hash?
      </p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>This is effectively the same case as Question 2, and the answers are the same. Code will produce a warning and the "last"
         key's value will be undef.
