      <h2>Properties - Quiz 1</h2> 
      
      
      
      
      <p>Name one important difference between how Perl treats the number <b>0.0</b> and the string <b>"0.0"</b>.</p>
      
        
      
      
      <p><b>0.0 (is a number)</b> will evaluate to false; <b>"0.0" (is a string)</b> will evaluate to true. This is the answer we're 
         looking for.
      </p>
      
      
      <p><b>Grading Criteria:</b> Student should be able to explain the truth value for each version of 0.0.</p>
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>The following code fragment is legal and produces the desired result but is confusing:</p>
      
      
      <div class="observeBox">
         <div class="observeTitle">Observe:</div>
         <div class="observe"><pre>unless ( $germ_count &lt; 50 )
{
&nbsp;print "Filthy\n";
}
elsif ( $germ_count &gt; 25 )
{
&nbsp;print "Dirty\n";
}
else
{
&nbsp;print "Clean\n";
}</pre></div>
      </div>
      
      
      <p>How is the code confusing?</p>
      
      
      <p>How would you make it clearer?</p>
      
        
      
      
      <div class="observeBox">
         <div class="observeTitle">Observe:</div>
         <div class="observe"><pre>if( $germ_count &gt;= 50) { ... }</pre></div>
      </div>
      
      
      <p>Common Issues:</p>
      
      
      <ul>
         <li>If the student overcomplicates their checks, for example by adding extra checks to elsif to check that $germ_count is 
            &lt; 50, instruct them that this check is not needed.
         </li>
         <li>If the student inverts the order of Filthy/Dirty/Clean, instruct them that the only change that needs to be made is for 
            the unless check and no other changes needs to be made.
         </li>
      </ul>
      
      
      <p><b>Grading Criteria:</b> Student should be able to describe the use of unless and double negatives and offer a solution using 
         an if statement.
      </p>
