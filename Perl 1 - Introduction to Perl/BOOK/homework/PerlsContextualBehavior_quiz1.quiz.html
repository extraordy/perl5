      <h2>Perl's Contextual Behavior - Quiz 1</h2> 
      
      
      
      
      <p>Look at the documentation for the reverse() function with <b>perldoc -f</b> and construct two statements as follows:</p>
      
      
      <ul>
         <li>Assume you have a scalar $phrase containing the string "A man, a plan, a canal--Panama," and assign to $rev the string 
            that contains all the characters of that phrase in reverse order.
         </li>
         <li>Assume you have an array @prices containing the prices of items in a store, ordered from least expensive to most 
            expensive. Assign to $priciest the most expensive price in the array. (There are several ways of doing this. Choose a 
            way that uses the reverse function in a single expression.)
         </li>
      </ul>
      
        
      
      
      <p>my $rev = reverse "A man, a plan, a canal--Panama";</p>
      
      
      <p>my ( $priciest ) = reverse @prices;</p>
      
      
      <p><b>Grading Criteria:</b> Student should demonstrate understanding of reverse in both scalar and list context.</p>
