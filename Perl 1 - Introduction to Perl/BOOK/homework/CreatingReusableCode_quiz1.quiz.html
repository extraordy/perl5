      <h2>Creating Reusable Code - Quiz 1</h2> 
      
      
      
      
      <p>When naming a subroutine, how can you be sure that its name doesn't conflict with a Perl built-in?</p>
      
        
      
      
      <p>Either do not name your subroutine the same as a built-in, or prepend your sub with a _ (underscore) to denote that it is
         a local copy.
      </p>
      
      
      <p><b>Grading Criteria:</b> Student should demonstrate an understanding of how Perl namespaces subroutines.</p>
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>What happens if you create a subroutine with a name that conflicts with a built-in function?</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>Most often, Perl will ignore your sub and use the built-in, sometimes you will get a warning depending on how tightly coupled
         
         the sub is (for example, UNIVERSAL::* will often throw a warning, though we do not really cover this in the lesson).
      </p>
      
      
      <p><b>Grading Criteria:</b> Student should demonstrate ability to both read documentation and build a test script.</p>
