      <p>When you read files with the <b>&lt;&gt;</b> operator, what does Perl do if one of the files you supply in <b>@ARGV</b> does 
         not exist?
      </p>
      
        
      
      
      <p>It emits the warning "Can't open <i>file</i>: No such file or directory" and goes on to the next one, if any.
      </p>
      
      
      <p><b>Grading Criteria:</b> Student should demonstrate understanding of how Perl will handle error cases when reading in files via &lt;&gt;.</p>
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>Look at <b>perldoc perlvar</b>. How can you keep track of what line number you've reached in an input file without having to keep count yourself?</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>$.</p>
      
      
      <p><b>Grading Criteria:</b> Student should show they know how to use perldoc to find the answers to questions not covered in the course.</p>
