   <p> Remember a few lessons ago when I referred to the 
    notion of something "expecting" a list and said, "We have an entire lesson dedicated to the intricacies of lists later")? Well, 
    "later" is now! One of the fundamental concepts in Perl is <i>context</i>.   
    The definitive book on the language, <a href=" http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596000271" target="_blank">Programming Perl</a>,
    claims that Perl programmers will be miserable until they learn it.
   
    Well, we certainly don't want that to happen to us, so let's get busy learning! 
    In basic terms, context in Perl is defined like this:</p>
   
    <p><div class="c">Any expression can be interpreted in several different ways; the way that is chosen depends on how
     the expression is being used.</div>
   </p>
  
   <p>
    This concept will become much more clear to you after we go over some examples.
    Let's review our code from insect_sales.pl:
   </p>
   
   <div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE:</div><div class="observe"><pre>
<span class="purple">my</span> <span class="darkred">$date</span> = <span class="darkgreen">localtime()</span>.
</pre></div></div>
  
   <p>
    The result of <span class="darkgreen">localtime()</span> is being assigned to a <i>scalar</i>, so we 
    say that the assignment places <span class="darkgreen">localtime()</span> in <b>scalar context</b>. And 
    <span class="darkgreen">localtime()</span> in a scalar context returns a
    string representing the current date and time. It would look something like this: <b>'Mon Aug 10 10:04:49 2009'</b>. 
   </p>
   <p>
    But <i>instead</i> of assigning <span class="darkgreen">localtime()</span> to a scalar, we could assign it to an 
    array. Let's try an example. Create a new file as shown:
   </p>
  
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE:</div><div class="listing"><pre><ins>#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

my @parts = localtime();
my $count = 0;
foreach my $part ( @parts )
{
  print "Element $count = $part\n";
  $count++; 
}</ins>
</pre></div></div>
  
   <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> Save it in your <b>/perl1</b> folder as <b>localtime.pl</b> and run it. </p>
   
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE TERMINAL SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~$ <ins>cd perl1</ins>
cold:~/perl1$ <ins>./localtime.pl</ins>
Element 0 = 0
Element 1 = 50
Element 2 = 18
Element 3 = 7
Element 4 = 11
Element 5 = 109
Element 6 = 1
Element 7 = 340
Element 8 = 0    
cold:~/perl1$    
</pre></div></div>
  
   <p>Before we go any further, take a good look at the code and see if you can 
    figure out what it means.</p>
  
   <p>Also, observe that the <b>++</b> operator is used for its side effect of 
    adding one to its operand, without looking at its value. This is a common use of the <b>++</b> operator.</p>  
   
   <p>Now, look at <b>perldoc -f localtime</b> or <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/functions/localtime.html" target="_blank">http://perldoc.perl.org/functions/localtime.html</a>. <span class="darkgreen">localtime()</span>  
    returns a list of numbers representing elements of the current date and time, so you can access 
    each element—the day, the month, etc.—individually.</p>
   
   <p>The important lesson here is that <span class="darkgreen">localtime()</span> behaves differently depending 
    upon the context. There are two important contexts to learn:</p>
   
   <ul><li>Scalar</li><li>List</li></ul>
  
   <p>And any expression can be placed into either context by putting it somewhere that "expects" either a 
    scalar or a list. For example, <b>print</b> expects a list of arguments, so if you 
    <b>print localtime()</b>, all of those numerical date/time elements will be printed out, one after 
    the other, without spaces in between them. If you wanted to print the scalar context value of 
    <span class="darkgreen">localtime()</span> without having to assign it to a scalar variable first, you'd 
    look for an expression that would put part of itself in scalar context. For example, string 
    concatenation:</p>
   
   <div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE:</div><div class="observe"><pre>
<span class="darkred">$x</span> <span class="darkgreen">.</span> <span class="darkred">$y</span>
</pre></div></div>
  
   <p> Perl only concatenates scalars, so the concatenation operator puts each of its arguments in scalar context:</p>

<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE:</div><div class="observe"><pre>
<span class="darkgreen">print localtime() . </span> <span class="orange">"\n"</span>;
</pre></div></div>
  
   <p>If you just want to print out a readable time in a hurry, that's a fine way of doing it, 
   although it might be challenging for others to read your code.</p>
   
   <p>There's no way of predicting how <span class="darkgreen">localtime()</span> 
    will behave in one context based on its behavior in another context. The people who wrote 
    <span class="darkgreen">localtime()</span> made good, useful choices, but there is no general rule for the way a function will behave 
    in a list context, even when you know its behavior in a scalar context or vice versa. 
    </p>
   
   <p>A scalar variable (say, <span class="darkred">$x</span>) in a scalar context, yields that variable. A scalar 
    variable in a list context (say, <span class="darkred">@y</span> = <span class="darkred">$x</span>) yields a list containing only that 
    variable. An array in a list context, for instance:</p>
  
   <div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE:</div><div class="observe"><pre>
(<span class="darkred">$x</span>, <span class="darkred">$y</span>) = <span class="darkred">@z</span>;
</pre></div></div>
  
   <p>...yields the list of elements in the array. In this particular case, we know that the array is in list context 
    because it's being assigned to a list—a set of scalars separated by commas <i>inside 
     parentheses</i>.</p> 
      
   <p>By the way, just because a code snippet doesn't declare its variables with
    <span class="purple">my</span>, doesn't mean you shouldn't. Sometimes I'll leave out the snippet of code that declares variables 
    just to make the code easier for you to read overall, but when you write a program, you need to include the
    <span class="purple">my</span> declarations. <span class="purple">use strict</span> won't let you get away with leaving out
     <span class="purple">my</span>, and you're always using <span class="purple">use strict</span>, aren't you?</p>
   
   <p>So, what about an array in a scalar context? Let's try that! Create a file called
    <b>scalar_array.pl</b> as shown:</p>
   
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE:</div><div class="listing"><pre><ins>#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

my @array = qw(apple pear loganberry starfruit durien kumquat);
my $whatever = @array;
print "Array in scalar context = $whatever\n";</ins>
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it. </p>
   
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE TERMINAL SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~/perl1$ <ins>./scalar_array.pl</ins>
Array in scalar context = 6
cold:~/perl1$    
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p>An array in a scalar context—used wherever Perl would expect a scalar—evaluates as the number 
    of elements in the array. Here are some ways of using scalar context to get to that: </p>
   
   <ul><li><span class="darkred">$count</span> = <span class="darkred">@array</span></li><li><span class="orange">0</span> <span class="darkgreen">+</span> <span class="darkred">@array</span></li><li><span class="darkgreen">scalar</span>( <span class="darkred">@array</span> )</li><li><span class="purple">while</span> ( <span class="darkred">@array</span> )</li></ul>
   
   <p>In the third item on the list, the <span class="darkgreen">scalar()</span> function is a Perl <i>built-in</i> that 
    forces its argument into scalar context. (There's no <span class="darkgreen">list()</span> function; you 
    won't need it.)</p>
   
   <p>Now take a look at the last item. How does that one work? The condition of a <span class="purple">while()</span> statement 
    must be either true or false, so it's evaluated in <i>Boolean context</i>, which is for 
    all practical purposes the same as scalar context. And whatever comes between the parentheses 
    is going to be put in scalar context.  By the way, this example demonstrates another important difference 
    between the <span class="purple">while</span> and <span class="purple">foreach</span> loops 
    (your homework from the previous lesson may come to mind): <span class="purple">while</span> puts the 
    contents of the parentheses—its condition—into 
    scalar context, and <span class="purple">foreach</span> puts the contents of its parentheses—its arguments—into list 
    context.)</p>
   
   <p>Let's incorporate that into one of our earlier examples. Create 
    a new file called <b>name_finder.pl</b> as shown:</p>
    
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE:</div><div class="listing"><pre><ins>#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

my @names = ("Charles Francis Xavier", "Hiram K. Hackenbacker", "James Moriarty", "Samuel Finley Breese Morse");
while ( @names )
{
  my $name = shift @names;
  my @parts = split ' ', $name;
  my $first_name = shift @parts;
  my $last_name = pop @parts;
  print "$name is sanitized to $last_name, $first_name\n";
}</ins>
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it. </p>
   
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE TERMINAL SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~/perl1$ <ins>./name_finder.pl</ins>
Charles Francis Xavier is sanitized to Xavier, Charles
Hiram K. Hackenbacker is sanitized to Hackenbacker, Hiram
James Moriarty is sanitized to Moriarty, James
Samuel Finley Breese Morse is sanitized to Morse, Samuel    
cold:~/perl1$    
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p>This version of the program will no longer stop when it hits an element of the array 
    <span class="darkred">@names</span> that happens to be false—not a likely possibility with names, but if 
    you're iterating over an array that might contain a false element, you'll want to take this 
    approach.
   </p>
   
   <p>Now, modify the program as shown:</p>
   
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE:</div><div class="listing"><pre>#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

my @names = ("Charles Francis Xavier", "Hiram K. Hackenbacker", "James Moriarty", "Samuel Finley Breese Morse");
<ins>foreach my $name ( @names )</ins>
{ 
  <del>my $name = shift @names;</del>
  my @parts = split ' ', $name;
  my $first_name = shift @parts;
  my $last_name = pop @parts;
  print "$name is sanitized to $last_name, $first_name\n";
}
</pre></div></div>   

   <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it. </p>
   
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE TERMINAL SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~/perl1$ <ins>./name_finder.pl</ins>
Charles Francis Xavier is sanitized to Xavier, Charles
Hiram K. Hackenbacker is sanitized to Hackenbacker, Hiram
James Moriarty is sanitized to Moriarty, James
Samuel Finley Breese Morse is sanitized to Morse, Samuel    
cold:~/perl1$    
</pre></div></div>

   <p>This version of the code does the same thing as the last one and demonstrates the array being placed in list 
    context. Because <span class="darkgreen">shift</span> isn't used, the array is not modified, and because 
    <span class="purple">foreach</span> specifies a block iteration variable (<span class="darkred">$name</span>), the code is 
    slightly shorter. This version is arguably better than the previous version.</p>
   
   <p>Any function in Perl may return different results in list context and scalar context, and 
    many do. When you learn to write your own functions (in the next lesson), you'll be able to tell 
    whether something was called in list context or scalar context by calling the 
    <span class="darkgreen">wantarray</span> built-in function.</p>
   
   <p>Keep in mind that when you assign to a list of scalars, they should be separated by commas and 
    surrounded by parentheses:</p>
   
   <p>(<span class="darkred">$x</span>, <span class="darkred">$y</span>, <span class="darkred">$z</span>) = ...</p>
   
   <p>Doing that puts the right side of the <b>=</b> sign into list context. So, what's the difference between these two 
    statements?:</p>
   
   <ul><li><span class="darkred">$x</span> = ...</li><li>(<span class="darkred">$x</span>) = ...</li></ul>
   
   <p>The first statement puts the right side of the <b>=</b> sign into scalar context; the second puts it into list 
    context. The list to which items are being assigned may have only one element in it, but it's still a list, as 
    opposed to a scalar that is not within a list (like in the first statement).</p>
   
   <p><table class="noteBox fBox pBox "><tr><td class="noteTitle">Note</td><td class="note">By the way, the authors of "Programming Perl" weren't kidding when they mentioned the misery
   that might follow when a programmer doesn't quite understand context. In fact, one person 
   has a police record as a result of not understanding the difference between scalar and list context! Read 
    <a href="http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=01/03/13/208259" target="_blank">this Slashdot article</a>, a real-life 
    cautionary tale!</td></tr></table></p>
   
   <p>This lesson is a little shorter than previous ones, because the homework is a little more labor intensive. There 
    are many subtleties to understand about lists and context in Perl, so hopefully you'll find yourself exploring. If you get 
    confused, stop and ask yourself whether you're wrestling with code that you might really want to use. 
    If it seems potentially useful, then keep going as far as you like!</p>
   
   <p>By now, you're getting a solid understanding of the fundamentals of Perl and you know quite a few things 
    that casual Perl programmers probably don't. You're doing great! Keep going!</p>
