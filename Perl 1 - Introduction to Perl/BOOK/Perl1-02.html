  <p>As gratifying as it may be to print strings, we can have a lot more fun using computers to do the 
   "heavy lifting" of calculating numbers. Quick! What's the square root of 147 times 19 plus 
   32!? We can write a program to help us solve this fast, without ever using a pencil.</p>
  
  <p>Create a new file named <b>simple_math.pl</b>, as shown in <ins>blue</ins>:</p>
   
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE:</div><div class="listing"><pre><ins>#!/usr/bin/perl

</pre></div></div>

  <p>Let's take a look at a few key elements in our code and see what's going on:</p>
  
  <ul><li><b>Commas</b> The comma indicates that <span class="darkgreen">print()</span> can take multiple 
    <i>arguments</i> (things to print). When we type commas in between the arguments, they'll get 
    printed one after the other. We call that series of things separated by commas a <i>list</i>—makes 
    sense, right? (More on those later!)</li><li><b>Precision</b> The answer has a bunch of digits that follow the decimal point. If you know a little
    about square roots, you know that the real answer would go on forever. So, why doesn't it? Well,
    you have to stop somewhere. Perl's precision is
    equal to that of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating_point" target="_blank">floating point</a> numbers your computer uses. (You can get it to print
    more digits if you use a special module called <span class="darkred">bignum</span>; but that's more 
    advanced than we want to be right now.)</li><li><b>Parentheses</b> Why do we have parentheses around the <ins>147</ins>? 
    Why <i>don't</i> we have them around the arguments to <span class="darkgreen">print</span>? We can answer these 
    questions by checking out what happens when we change those conditions. First let's take the parentheses away completely:</li></ul>
    
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO EDIT:</div><div class="listing"><pre>#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

<ins>print sqrt 147 * 19 + 32, "\n";
</ins>
</pre></div></div>
  
  <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it.</p>
  
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE TERMINAL SESSION</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~/perl1$ <ins>./simple_math.pl</ins>
53.1507290636732
cold:~/perl1$ 
</pre></div></div>
 
  <p>Now put the parentheses back in, and add a second pair:</p>
   
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO EDIT:</div><div class="listing"><pre>#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

<ins>print(sqrt(147) * 19 + 32, "\n");
</ins>
</pre></div></div>
  
  <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it.</p>
  
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE TERMINAL SESSION</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~/perl1$ <ins>./simple_math.pl</ins>
262.362757406661
cold:~/perl1$ 
</pre></div></div>
  
  <p>So what's going on here? First, we need to address a little thing called <i>precedence</i>. The original 
   problem—"the square root of 147 times 19 plus 32"—is a bit ambiguous. Does it mean:
  </p>
  <ul><li>((the square root of 147) times 19) plus 32</li><li>((the square root of 147) times (19 plus 32)</li><li>the square root of ((147 times 19) plus 32)</li></ul>
  <p>...or any of several other possibilities? I added  
   parentheses so you could figure out the meaning of the expression. We use parentheses the same 
   way in Perl. If you don't have parentheses in place to indicate which tasks to execute first, 
   your Perl program uses 
   rules of <i>precedence</i> to determine 
   the order that it will execute operators like <b>+</b>, <b>*</b>, and <b>sqrt</b>. So looking back up the page at the 
   results of the totally parentheses-free statement, which parts of the 
   calculation do you suppose Perl did first, second, and third?</p>
  
  <p>Built-in functions like <span class="darkgreen">print()</span> don't require
   parentheses around their arguments. Most languages
   don't give you a choice—you <i>must</i> include them—but parentheses are optional in
   Perl. You can include them if you like, or if you need them to prevent Perl from
   making the wrong assumption about where your function arguments end. Programmers 
   who are used to working in languages where parentheses are required tend to include them all the time, 
   but with Perl, we usually leave them off the outermost function call (the leftmost one in a statement, for example, 
   <span class="darkgreen">print()</span> in the lines above). The code is more readable when
   it isn't cluttered with extra parentheses. In this course we'll always follow
   the best practices for Perl, including the economical use of parentheses.</p>
  
  <a name="s_01"></a><div id="s_01"><div class="subheading">Perl's Operators</div><div class="subheadingText">
   
   <p>Perl has <i>lots</i> of operators. You can always 
    look up an operator in <b>perldoc</b> locally or at:
    <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/perlop.html" target="_blank">http://perldoc.perl.org/perlop.html</a>. 
    Let's use some of them to calculate the volume of a sphere with a radius of 7.5 meters:</p>
   
   <p><div class="c"><img src="images/ball.jpg"></div></p>
   
   
   <p>Create a file named <b>sphere.pl</b>. Type the code below into the console as shown:</p> 
   
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE:</div><div class="listing"><pre><ins>#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

print "Volume of sphere of radius 7.5 = ";
print 4/3 * 3.14159265 * (7.5 ** 3), "\n";</ins>  
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it:</p>
   
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE TERMINAL SESSION</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~/perl1$ <ins>./sphere.pl</ins>
Volume of sphere of radius 7.5 = 1767.145865625
cold:~/perl1$ 
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p>We couldn't just type in <b>pi</b>, because Perl doesn't know what it means, so we 
   typed <ins>3.14159265</ins> instead. And rather than take 
    the time to look up the precedence of the <i>exponentiation</i> operator 
    (<ins>**</ins>), we put parentheses in to make it clear that we are cubing 
    <ins>7.5</ins> and nothing else, even if precedence means the parentheses may not be 
    necessary.</p>
  
  </div></div>
  <a name="s_02"></a><div id="s_02"><div class="subheading">Scalar Variables</div><div class="subheadingText">
   
   <p>You know, if this was all we could do with Perl, we'd be better off buying a cheap calculator. 
    But there's more to Perl than math operations. This is where <i>variables</i> come in: we can put 
    numbers and other things into little 
    chunks of memory and give them names. Perl has several kinds of variables; the most 
    important and basic kind is the <b>scalar variable</b>.  The word "scalar" means "has only one thing." 
     A scalar variable stores exactly one thing: a 
    number or a string.</p>
   
   <p>Most languages don't make their variables look special in any way, but Perl uses punctuation 
    characters as prefixes to make variables stand out. The punctuation character for scalars is the 
    dollar sign, <b>$</b> (because it looks like an "S," for "scalar"). Following the 
    <b>$</b> is a name that you (the programmer) select. Pick any name you like, as long as it 
    follows these rules: </p>
   
   <ul><li>It contains only uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, or underscores.</li><li>It starts with a letter or an underscore.</li><li>It can't be just a single underscore.</li></ul>

   <p>When we want to use a scalar variable in our program, we have to inform Perl of our plan by declaring 
    the variable before we use it. We do that using the keyword <b>my</b>. We 
    can also assign a value to the variable at the same time with the <b>=</b> operator.</p> 
    
   <p>Let's try an example. Create a new program
    named <b>sphere_variable.pl</b> file as shown:</p>
   
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE:</div><div class="listing"><pre><ins>#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

my $radius;
$radius = 7.5;
my $PI = 3.14159265;
my $volume = 4/3 * $PI * ($radius ** 3);
print "Volume of sphere of radius ", $radius, " = ", $volume, "\n";</ins>   
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it:</p>
   
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE TERMINAL SESSION</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~/perl1$ <ins>./sphere_variable.pl</ins>
Volume of sphere of radius 7.5 = 1767.145865625
cold:~/perl1$ 
</pre></div></div>
   
    <p>Did you get the same result as before? Hopefully you did. </p>
    
    <p>Now, behold the power of variables!: 
    Change the <ins>7.5</ins> to 
    <ins>49.4</ins> and run the program again. Perl adjusts the output accordingly. 
    We can also use scalars as items in the list of arguments we pass to 
    <span class="darkgreen">print()</span>.</p>
   
   <p>In our programs, we'll assign values to variables as
    we declare them, like we did above with <ins>my $PI = 3.14159265;</ins>, but in mature programs,
    it's common to declare a scalar without giving it a value initially. </p>
    
   <p><i>Only enter</i> 
    <ins>my</ins> <i>once per variable</i>. If you do it more than once, you'll get an error. Try it!</p>
   
   <p>Let's try another example. Create the file <b>metric.pl</b> as shown:</p>
   
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE:</div><div class="listing"><pre><ins>#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

# Convert meters to feet
my $feet = 5280;   # One mile
my $meters = $feet / 3.2808399;
print $feet, " feet is ", $meters, " meters\n";</ins>
</pre></div></div>

   <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it:</p>
   
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE TERMINAL SESSION</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~/perl1$ <ins>./metric.pl</ins>
5280 feet is 1609.3439975538 meters
cold:~/perl1$ 
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p>Here you can see Perl's <i>comment</i> feature. Everything from a pound (#) sign on to the 
    end of the line is a comment (this is one case where line breaks <i>are</i> significant to Perl).
    But if the pound (<ins><b>#</b></ins>) sign is inside of a string (between quotation marks), 
    it's not a comment, it's just part of 
    the string. Also, the shebang line at the beginning does not indicate a comment; it 
    follows special rules that apply only when the first two 
    characters in the file are <ins>#!</ins>.</p>   
  
  </div></div>
  <a name="s_03"></a><div id="s_03"><div class="subheading">Naming Conventions</div><div class="subheadingText">
   
   <p>In programming as in life, there are <i>rules</i> and then there are <i>conventions</i>. A rule <i>must</i> be followed or 
    your program won't work. Following convention is not <i>required</i>, but they are recommended standards
    that programmers have agreed to adopt to make life easier for all.</p> 
   
    
   <p>So in addition to the rules to be adhered to when naming scalars, there are some conventions about 
    naming them as well:</p>
   
   <ul><li>Constants are typed in <span class="darkred">$ALL_CAPITAL_LETTERS</span>.</li><li>Local variables are <span class="darkred">$lower_case</span>.</li><li>Global variables are in <span class="darkred">$Title_Case</span>.</li><li>Words in the name are separated by underscores, as you see above.</li></ul>
   
   <p>These conventions differ from those recommended for some other popular programming languages, and 
    while you could use those conventions in Perl, your programs would look like they 
    were written with a funny accent.</p>
    
    <p> We haven't yet covered the difference between local and global 
    variables, so for the moment pretend they're all local variables. As for constants, we saw an 
     example of one above: <span class="darkred">$PI</span>.</p>
   
   <p>Picking good names for variables is one of the most important skills a programmer has, so put 
    some thought into it whenever you write a program.</p>
   
   <p>Variables don't <i>have</i> to be initialized (given an initial value) when you declare them, 
    mind you. Here's another program for you to write that demonstrates this. Create 
    <b>from_metric.pl</b> as shown:</p>
   
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE:</div><div class="listing"><pre><ins>#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

# Convert liters to various US measurements of volume
my $liters = 2.5;

my $LITERS_TO_FL_OZ   = 1000 / 29.574;
my $LITERS_TO_PINTS   = 1 / .4731;
my $LITERS_TO_GALLONS = $LITERS_TO_PINTS / 8;
my $LITERS_TO_CU_IN   = 1000 / 16.387;

print $liters, " liters = ",
      $liters * $LITERS_TO_FL_OZ,   " fluid ounces, ",
      $liters * $LITERS_TO_PINTS,   " pints, ",
      $liters * $LITERS_TO_GALLONS, " gallons, ",
      $liters * $LITERS_TO_CU_IN,   " cubic inches\n";
</ins></pre></div></div>

   <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it:</p>
   
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE TERMINAL SESSION</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~/perl1$ <ins>./from_metric.pl</ins>
2.5 liters = 84.5337120443633 fluid ounces, 5.28429507503699 pints, 0.660536884379624 gallons, 152.559956062733 cubic inches
cold:~/perl1$ 
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p>See how we split a very long <span class="darkgreen">print()</span> statement over multiple lines there? 
    We could have used multiple <span class="darkgreen">print()</span> statements instead, like we did 
    before, but as it says at the top of the famous <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596004927.do" target="_blank">camel book</a> for Perl, "There's More Than One Way To Do It."</p> 
   
   <p><div class="c"><img src="images/TMTOWTDI.png"></div></p>

   <p>Take another look at our example code to see how we used spaces to make things line up vertically.  Perl doesn't mind, and it 
    makes the program easier to read.</p> 

   <p>Now we're going to break the program intentionally. Make the changes as shown in <ins>blue</ins>:</p>

   <p>It's a good thing we included <span class="darkblue">use warnings</span> in our code, because this program produces 
    warnings! Perl complains about the use of an <i>uninitialized</i> value. In this case, we can see what's 
    uninitialized: <ins>$liters</ins>. So, what value does it have? It has the special <i>undefined</i> value 
    in Perl called  <b>undef</b>. You can actually assign <b>undef</b> to a scalar explicitly.</p>
   
   <p>But wait—Perl still executed the <span class="darkgreen">print</span> statement, it just put zero in for 
    every calculation. What's that all about? Well, the messages you saw were <i>warnings</i>; in  
    other words, not a big enough a problem for Perl to stop running. (You might disagree, but Perl is a 
    pretty promiscuous language!) When Perl sees <b>undef</b> used in a calculation, it 
    produces a warning (as long as you have <span class="darkblue">use warnings</span> enabled) and then assumes a value of
    zero instead of <b>undef</b>, then just keeps going. </p>
   
   <p>Finally, take the <span class="darkblue">use warnings</span> line out of the program and rerun it. 
   The results look pretty bad, right? That's why we always put 
    <span class="darkblue">use warnings</span> in every program.</p> 
   
   <p>You may have noticed that we haven't distinguished integers from 
    floating point values in our programs. That's because Perl handles everything for us behind the scenes. If 
    it can store a number in an integer, it does. If it needs a floating point value instead, it 
    uses that. When an integer value needs to change to a floating point value (perhaps because it's 
    being divided by a number that doesn't go into it evenly), Perl "promotes" it to a floating point 
    number. Of course, some numbers can't be represented exactly in a computer because it only has
    a limited number of bits available for storing numbers (see the discussion about "precision" 
    above).</p>
   
   <p>You're doing great so far, and starting to get a real feel for the power of Perl. 
   More cool stuff awaits you in the next lesson!</p>
