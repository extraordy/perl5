  <p>One of the guiding principles of computer program design has been distilled into this 
   simple phrase: <b>D</b>on't <b>R</b>epeat <b>Y</b>ourself<sup> </sup> (<b>DRY</b>).*</p>
  
  <p>In other words, don't write the same code twice if it's doing the same thing each time. 
   Instead, put that code in one place and call it from the two (or more) places that you need it.</p>
 
  <p>So, how do you do that?  Great question. Consider the <span class="darkgreen">printf()</span> function. Imagine for now that 
   it doesn't exist, but you need its functionality. You write some code that will format a number in a 
   fixed-width field by turning the number into a string, calling the <span class="darkgreen">length()</span> function, 
   printing out the number of spaces you need, and so on.</p>
  
  <p>Later, you need to do that again in a different part of your program to a different number. Do you write 
   the same code out again?  Of course not—but 
   you'd be amazed at how often people do just that! 
   Fortunately, we are not those people. Instead, we'll use the <span class="darkgreen">printf()</span> function to
   help us call our code whenever we need it.</p>

  <p>We create this kind of reusable code using <b>subroutines</b>.</p>
 
  <p><sup>*</sup> This concept first appeared in <i>The Pragmatic Programmer</i>, by Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas 
   (Addison-Wesley, 1999).</p>
  
  <a name="s_01"></a><div id="s_01"><div class="subheading">Subroutines</div><div class="subheadingText">
   
   <p>A subroutine is the basic building block of reusable code in Perl. If you've used the equivalent of 
    subroutines in other languages, you may be familiar with terms like <i>functions</i> and 
    <i>procedures</i>. We don't use the term "procedures" in Perl 
    programming, and when we talk about "functions," we're generally referring to built-in functions. 
    Technically there's no difference in behavior between functions and subroutines though. Also,
    subroutines in Perl always refer to code written by the programmer, not a part of Perl itself.</p>
   
   <p>If you have programmed things like subroutines in other languages, put that knowledge aside for 
    this lesson. Perl subroutines work much more simply than subroutines in other languages, and several of the 
    features you may be used to using don't exist in Perl. </p>
   
   <p>Here's how you define a subroutine in Perl:</p>
   
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE:</div><div class="observe"><pre>
<span class="purple">sub</span> my_sub
{
  # Body of subroutine
} 
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p>This subroutine is named <b>my_sub</b>. Here's how you'd call it from somewhere in 
    your Perl program: </p>   
   
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE:</div><div class="observe"><pre>
my_sub( ... );
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p>Pretty cool, huh? The ellipsis (<b>...</b>) indicates that "any arguments go here."</p>
   
   <p>When you run a Perl program, Perl actually reads your entire program before doing anything—this 
    is called the <i>compilation</i> phase (it happens much faster in Perl than it does in most other compiled languages). 
    Then Perl runs your program. When Perl encounters the definition of a subroutine during 
    compilation, it tucks it away and remembers it. When Perl runs your program, it's as though the 
    subroutine definitions aren't there—they don't get executed until they are called from a part of 
    the program that's not in a subroutine definition. (Subroutines that aren't called at 
    all are referred to as <i>orphaned code</i> and might as well be left out of your programs.)</p>
      
   <p>Before we go on, let's go over few guidelines to make sure that you'll follow best practices 
    and don't become confused by Perl's flexible subroutines syntax options:</p>  
   
   <ul><li>Define your subroutines after the main code (this makes the code more readable).</li><li>Call your subroutines with parentheses, even if there are no arguments between the parentheses.</li><li>Don't give a subroutine the same name as a Perl built-in function.</li></ul>
   
   <p>That last rule might seem a bit difficult to follow—I mean, how can you remember the names of all the Perl 
    built-ins? And what are they anyway?</p>
    
   <p>Well, you can look them over them if you execute <b>perldoc perlfunc</b> (or <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/perlfunc.html" target="_blank">http://perldoc.perl.org/perlfunc.html</a>). It's a big page. In fact, this 
    is the source of [perldoc -f] information. You don't have to read the whole thing; all of the 
    functions are listed in groups at the top of the page.</p>
   
   <p>Still, implementing that third rule looks like a lot of work. 
   Fortunately, we have another rule to add that will eliminate a big chunk of that work:</p>
   
   <ul><li>Include an underscore in your subroutine 
    name.</li></ul> 
    
    <p>The presence of the underscore <i>guarantees</i> that your subroutine will not have the same name as a built-in, because none 
    of the built-ins have underscores in their names.</p>
   
   <p>Believe it or not, after enough programming in Perl, you'll know the built-in function names well 
    enough to be able to skip the underscore rule, but until then, use them. 
    Just think of a brief description of your subroutine's task, write it in terms of a few words, 
    and then put underscores between 
    the words, like this: </p>
   
   <ul><li>trim_strings()</li><li>add_costs()</li><li>ping_servers()</li><li>launch_nuclear_missiles()</li></ul>
   
   <p>(If you find yourself writing a Perl subroutine with that last name, please email me before putting it 
    into production. I'd like to check your code.)</p>
   
   <p>Let's explore how subroutines work with an example. Create 
    a new file called <b>magnitude.pl</b> as shown:</p>

<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~$ <ins>cd perl1</ins>

7893420000 = 7.89342 G
42 = 42
264340000000 = 264.34 G

   <p>Our output tells us that our program is turning big 
    numbers into more manageable numbers by adding the common suffixes of 'K' for kilo (thousand), 
    'M' for mega (million), 'G' for giga (billion), and 'T' for tera (thousand billion).</p>
   
   <p>In addition to subroutines, this program introduces us to the term <b>digraph</b>. "Digraph" refers to any 
   pair of characters together that means something 
    special. For example, <span class="darkblue">=&gt;</span> means the same thing as a comma, except that Perl pretends there are single 
    quotation marks around the word to the left of it, provided that word is "well-behaved." For our 
    purposes that means it obeys the same rules of syntax as something that would be legal as the identified part of 
    a variable (coming after the <b>$</b> for a scalar or the <b>@</b> of an array name). The Perl term for 
    that digraph is the <b>fat comma</b>, and it's an example of what we call <b>syntactic sugar</b>, that is, something 
    that isn't absolutely necessary (because we could do it with existing syntax), but it makes reading the program easier.
    If I didn't use the digraph in that code, this line:</p>
      
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: with fat comma</div><div class="observe"><pre>
<span class="purple">my</span> <span class="darkred">@threshold</span> = ( <span class="orange">K</span> =&gt; <span class="orange">1E3</span>, <span class="orange">M</span> =&gt; <span class="orange">1E6</span>, <span class="orange">G</span> =&gt; <span class="orange">1E9</span>, <span class="orange">T</span> =&gt; <span class="orange">1E12</span> );
</pre></div></div>
    
   <p>...would read:</p>
   
   <div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: without fat comma</div><div class="observe"><pre>
<span class="purple">my</span> <span class="darkred">@threshold</span> = ( <span class="orange">'K'</span>, <span class="orange">1E3</span>, <span class="orange">'M'</span>, <span class="orange">1E6</span>, <span class="orange">'G'</span>, <span class="orange">1E9</span>, <span class="orange">'T'</span>, <span class="orange">1E12</span> );
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p>Which version do you prefer?  Why? (These questions are designed to get you thinking about code 
    <i>readability</i> and <i>maintainability</i>.)</p>
   
   <p>Okay, now let's look at how the subroutine works here. We're <i>calling</i> the routine 
    <span class="darkgreen">number_suffix</span> with one argument (<span class="darkred">$bignum</span>) each time through the 
    <span class="purple">foreach</span> loop. We're getting back a string that is suitable for printing (contains the 
    scaled number and its suffix). So what happens in between? </p>
   
   <p>The code in the body of <span class="darkgreen">number_suffix</span> is executed, starting with the line:</p>
  
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: subroutine argument</div><div class="observe"><pre>
<span class="purple">my</span> <span class="darkred">$n</span> = <span class="darkgreen">shift</span>;
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p>Now, we know what <span class="darkgreen">shift</span> does—but what array are we shifting? We're shifting the 
    special array:</p>

   <p><span class="darkred">@_</span></p>
   
   <p>That's an underscore. Within the definition of a subroutine in Perl, the default array in 
    <span class="darkgreen">pop</span> and <span class="darkgreen">shift</span> is <span class="darkred">@_</span>, so: </p>
   
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: subroutine argument</div><div class="observe"><pre>
<span class="purple">my</span> <span class="darkred">$n</span> = <span class="darkgreen">shift</span>;
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p>...is exactly the same as:</p>
      
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: subroutine argument</div><div class="observe"><pre>
<span class="purple">my</span> <span class="darkred">$n</span> = <span class="darkgreen">shift</span> <span class="darkred">@_</span>;
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p>...when it's inside a subroutine definition. The universal idiom (common coding practice) is to 
    leave out the <span class="darkred">@_</span> in this case, so that's what we've done.</p>
   
   <p>So, what is the <span class="darkred">@_</span> array? It's the array in which the actual arguments to the 
    subroutine are passed. In this case, <span class="darkred">@_</span> will contain one element, <span class="darkred">$bignum</span> 
    (technically, it contains an <i>alias</i> to <span class="darkred">$bignum</span>), and the <span class="darkgreen">shift</span> 
    line takes that element out of <span class="darkred">@_</span> and copies it into <span class="darkred">$n</span>. Because <span class="darkred">$n</span> is 
    <i>declared</i> with <span class="purple">my</span> inside the body of the subroutine, only the code in that 
    subroutine body can reference that <span class="darkred">$n</span>.</p>
   
   <p>Finally, the body of the subroutine calculates the result. 
   When it comes time to 
    return a result—because we do assign the result of <span class="darkgreen">number_suffix</span> to something 
    (<span class="darkred">$nice_form</span>)—we use the special keyword <span class="purple">return</span> to mean, "return from the 
    subroutine now and pass back whatever comes after <span class="purple">return</span> as the result."</p>
   
   <p><div class="c"><img src="images/subroutine.png"></div></p>
   
   <p>If you've programmed subroutines (or functions, or procedures) in other 
    languages before, you may be pondering questions about 
    prototypes, and return signatures, and pass-by-reference, and variadic argument lists.
    Don't worry about that stuff; Perl doesn't use 
    or need them. Also, it's possible in Perl to overwrite an argument passed to a subroutine—called an INOUT parameter in 
    some languages—but it's bad practice, so don't even try. 
    And there you have it. You've just learned everything you need to know about subroutines in Perl. Nice, huh?</p>
   
   <p>Let's keep going! Perl will let you return a 
    list by entering your list after <span class="purple">return</span>. And Perl has no problem allowing you to assign
    variables you're passing. It looks like this:</p>
   
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: result assignment</div><div class="observe"><pre>
(<span class="darkred">$x</span>, <span class="darkred">$y</span>) = <span class="darkgreen">cube_it</span>( <span class="darkred">$x</span>, <span class="darkred">$y</span> );
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p>This code is preferable to overwriting arguments in place, because in this code, the action is made clear to the caller.</p>
   
   <p>There is <i>no</i> validation of parameters—you can pass zero arguments to a subroutine on 
    one call and five thousand arguments on the next, and Perl won't complain. If you don't want people to 
    call your subroutine in a particular way, it's up to you to inspect the size and contents of 
    <span class="darkred">@_</span> and make your own complaint. Here's how we might do that in our example. Edit <b>magnitude.pl</b>
     as shown:</p>

   <p>We're calling <span class="darkgreen">number_suffix</span> three different ways: first in scalar 
    context (because the result is assigned to <span class="darkred">$nice_form</span>); second in list context 
    (because it appears in the argument <i>list</i> of the <span class="darkgreen">print</span> function); and  
    third in a new context to you, <i>void</i> context (because there is <i>no</i> assignment to 
    anything). We can use <span class="darkgreen">wantarray()</span> to figure out which context is in use
    (and yes, it should have been called <span class="darkgreen">wantlist()</span>, but 
    we're stuck with it now). <span class="darkgreen">wantarray()</span> returns a true value when we're in list 
    context, a false (but defined) value in scalar context, and the undefined value in void context. 
    We test for the last case using the built-in function 
    <span class="darkgreen">defined()</span>, which returns false if its argument is undefined. Make sense?</p>
   
   <p>Be sure you understand how your code works; in particular, why there is a 
    space between the number and the 
    'G' suffix in the first line of output, but not the second.</p>
   
   <p>The void context case of this subroutine actually violates a number of good practices 
    in code design, but we let it slide this time, just for the sake of example. 
    Usually we don't even test for void context when 
    writing subroutines, but it's good practice to test for scalar versus list context if you think your 
    subroutine might return different things in each context.</p>
   
   <p>A few important notes concerning the results of your subroutine queries:</p>
   
   <ul><li>You don't have to use the results that a subroutine returns; you can ignore them by calling it
     in void context. (If you don't want someone to call in void context, now you know how to test for 
     it!)</li><li>Subroutines don't have to contain a <span class="purple">return</span> statement, but all subroutines
     return something. If they come to the end of their definition without encountering a
     <span class="purple">return</span> statement, then they will return the value of the last expression that was 
     evaluated in any statement. If your subroutine will only be called in void context, none of this matters.</li><li>If you enter an empty <span class="purple">return;</span> (no arguments) in a subroutine, it will return the 
     undefined value in a scalar context and the empty list in a list context. This can be really useful in 
     well-designed subroutines.</li></ul>
   
   <p>Let's do one more example so you can see the common practice for reading multiple arguments. Create 
    a new file called <b>make_metric.pl</b> as shown:</p>

   <p>A few more characteristics of subroutines to take note of:</p>
   
   <ul><li>The <span class="darkred">$quantity</span> inside <span class="darkgreen">make_metric</span> is different from the 
     <span class="darkred">$quantity</span> earlier in the program, because it is declared in the subroutine with 
     <span class="purple">my</span>. After that declaration (which also initializes it to the first element of 
     <span class="darkred">@_</span>), the subroutine <span class="darkgreen">make_metric</span> cannot even see the 
     <span class="darkred">$quantity</span> in the outer program—it has no way to refer to it.</li><li>Unlike our earlier example, this program does not take anything out of <span class="darkred">@_</span>—it could go 
     back to the array again if it wanted to, but the universal best practice is to copy the arguments out in 
     the first line of the subroutine and never refer to <span class="darkred">@_</span> again. The alternative is to 
     <span class="darkgreen">shift</span> the elements out of <span class="darkred">@_</span> into variables that are local to the 
     subroutine—as we did with <span class="darkred">magnitude.pl</span>—but we usually don't take that approach if 
     we expect to be passed more than one argument.</li><li>This program follows a best practice of declaring "magic numbers" (the conversion factors) up at the 
     top of the program by putting them in variables with descriptive names. For more best practices, see the 
     book <a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596001735" target="_blank">Perl Best Practices</a> by Damian Conway (O'Reilly, 2005).</li></ul>

  <p>Subroutines are handy and will save us a lot of time. Experiment
  and play around with what you've learned to make sure you can take full advantage of them.  See you in the next lesson!</p>
