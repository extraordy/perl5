  <p>Welcome back! In this lesson, you'll learn about using strings in Perl to manipulate text. </p>

  <a name="s_01"></a><div id="s_01"><div class="subheading">String Conditions</div><div class="subheadingText">
 
   <p>We've already compared numeric quantities in Perl. Here's a quick 
    refresher:</p>
 
   <div class="c"><table class="tbl"><tr><th>Operator</th><th>Example</th><th>Meaning</th></tr><tr><td>==</td><td>$x == $y</td><td> $x equals $y</td></tr><tr><td>!=</td><td>$x != $y</td><td>$x does not equal $y</td></tr><tr><td>&lt;</td><td>$x &lt; $y</td><td>$x is less than $y</td></tr><tr><td>&gt;</td><td>$x &gt; $y</td><td>$x is greater than $y</td></tr><tr><td>&lt;=</td><td>$x &lt;= $y</td><td>$x is less than or equal to $y</td></tr><tr><td>&gt;=</td><td>$x &gt;= $y</td><td>$x is greater than or equal to $y</td></tr></table></div>
 
   <p>There are equivalent operators for testing strings:</p>
  
   <div class="c"><table class="tbl"><tr><th>Operator</th><th>Example</th><th>Meaning</th></tr><tr><td>eq</td><td>$x eq $y</td><td> $x equals $y</td></tr><tr><td>ne</td><td>$x ne $y</td><td>$x does not equal $y</td></tr></table></div>
 
   <p>Some additional numeric equivalent operators in Perl are:
    <b>lt</b>, <b>gt</b>, <b>le</b>, and <b>ge</b>. I didn't include them in the table above though, 
    because you will almost never use them—in nearly 20 years of Perl programming I have used each of them 
    maybe once. (We use different operators for sorting, but we'll get to 
    them later.)</p>
 
   <p>The other Perl operators you've met so far are composed of 
    punctuation characters or symbols like <b>&lt;</b>. These (and other) operators are composed of letters and so you should leave white 
    space around them. This makes it easier for people to read and avoids the possibility of syntax errors, such as you'd get if you wrote this 
    code: <b>$xeq$y</b>. Perl would look for a variable <b>$xeq</b>. 
    (Perl reads to find the next complete variable name, even if that 
    variable doesn't exist), and that variable would then be followed by another variable 
    <b>$y</b>, which cannot follow a variable in Perl's <i>grammar</i> 
    (the language that describes the rules that apply to Perl programs).</p>
 
   <p>Why do we need separate operators to compare strings in 
    Perl? Since a scalar can contain either a string or a number, and Perl knows which type of item is stored in the 
    scalar, wouldn't one set of operators do? Then we could just let Perl figure 
    out whether to compare things numerically or lexicographically, right?</p>
 
   <p>These are all really good questions—the kind that keep language designers awake nights. Here's why we need two sets of 
    operators. Suppose <span class="darkred">$x</span> was a string and <span class="darkred">$y</span> was a number, and we were using a generic operator 
    to compare them. Would Perl compare them numerically, or lexicographically?</p>
   
   <p>Perl helps by "coercing" (translating) numbers into strings and vice-versa. If  
    a number is stored in a scalar and you're applying a string operator or function to it, Perl will turn the number 
    into a string first. That string will yield the same result as if you printed the 
    scalar (because <b>print</b> is a string function). Numbers get printed—and 
    stringified—in a specific format (truncated after a certain number of digits, trailing 
    zeroes after a decimal point suppressed, and such). And if a string is stored in a scalar and 
    you use a numeric operator or function on it, Perl turns it 
    into a number first. Now every number can be turned into a string. But not every string 
    can be turned into a number. The string <span class="orange">"123"</span> can be turned into the 
    number <span class="orange">123</span>. The string <span class="orange">"-42.87248233449873687634904095912249135"</span> 
    can be turned into a number, but we lose the digits that Perl 
    doesn't have the precision to store.</p>
 
   <p>But what should Perl do with the string 
    <span class="orange">"petunia"</span> when asked to turn it into a number? Perl has some helpful rules in this kind of situation. 
    It reads a string and as long as it 
    finds characters that are legally part of a number, it keeps going. If it has to give up before 
    the end of the string, it returns whatever it found up to that point, and if <b>use warnings</b> is turned on, 
    it gives a warning. 
    So the string <span class="orange">"21 Jump Street"</span> 
    evaluates as the number <span class="orange">21</span> with a warning. If Perl doesn't read <i>any</i> legal 
    numeric characters, then it returns <b>undef</b> which, when treated as a number, 
    <i>evaluates as zero</i>. So <span class="orange">"petunia" + 42</span> will evaluate to <span class="orange">42</span>, 
    with a warning <b>argument "petunia" isn't numeric in addition</b> (so long as <b>use warnings</b> is on).  
    It's important to turn on <b>use warnings</b>, otherwise you'd have no 
    idea that you were trying to add a number to a flower!</p>
 
   <p>So even though Perl lets us store a number in a scalar and later store a string in the same 
    scalar, it's important that we know the type of item we expect to be stored in any variable when we 
    prepare to perform a comparison on it. Perl's coercion rules help us read values from somewhere else, 
    when they are always read as strings, 
    without having to waste time converting elements that we know are numbers.</p>
 
   <p>Let's do a straightforward string comparison example so you get the hang of it. 
    Create the file called <b>fruit_check.pl</b> as shown:</p>
 
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE:</div><div class="listing"><pre><ins>#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

my $fruit;
$fruit = 'apple';

if ( $fruit eq 'lemon' || $fruit eq 'orange' || $fruit eq 'lime' )
{
  print "Citrus... juicy!\n";
}
elsif ( $fruit eq 'strawberry' || $fruit eq 'raspberry' || $fruit eq 'blackberry' || $fruit eq 'loganberry' )
{
  print "Berry...\n";
  if ( $fruit ne 'loganberry' )
  {
    print "pie!\n";
  }
}
else
{
  print "Some other kind of fruit!\n";
}</ins>
</pre></div></div>
 
   <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it.</p>
   
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE TERMINAL SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~$ <ins>cd perl1</ins>
cold:~/perl1$ <ins>./fruit_check.pl</ins>
Some other kind of fruit!    
cold:~/perl1$ 
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p>Experiment with the program by assigning the <span class="darkred">$fruit</span> variable to a string
    other than <span class="darkblue">'apple'</span>.  Use some of 
    the other fruits mentioned in the program.  We used the <span class="darkblue">||</span> operator to mean "or" 
    in a logical expression, and the <span class="darkblue">eq</span> and <span class="darkblue">ne</span> operators to compare 
    strings.</p>
   
  </div></div>
  <a name="s_02"></a><div id="s_02"><div class="subheading">String Functions and Operators</div><div class="subheadingText">
 
   <p>In Perl, we can join strings together, make them 
    uppercase and lowercase, find out how long they are—the list goes on...</p>
 
   <p>The function <span class="darkgreen">lc()</span> makes strings lowercase. The function <span class="darkgreen">uc()</span> makes 
    strings uppercase. These functions are really useful when you want to compare strings without regard to case. 
    Modify <b>fruit_check.pl</b> as shown:</p>
 
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO EDIT:</div><div class="listing"><pre>#!/usr/bin/perl

<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE TERMINAL SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~/perl1$ <ins>./fruit_check.pl</ins>
Some other kind of fruit!    
cold:~/perl1$ 
</pre></div></div>
 
   <p>Oops! <span class="orange">'Orange'</span> is the same as <span class="orange">'orange'</span> for 
    <i>our</i> purposes, but if we want a computer to think they're equivalent, we have to explain 
    it. Modify the program as shown:</p>
   
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE:</div><div class="listing"><pre>#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

my $fruit;
$fruit = 'Orange';

<ins>my $fruit_lc = lc( $fruit );
if ( $fruit_lc eq 'lemon' || $fruit_lc eq 'orange' || $fruit_lc eq 'lime' )
</ins>{
  print "Citrus... juicy!\n";
}
<ins>elsif ( $fruit_lc eq 'strawberry' || $fruit_lc eq 'raspberry' 
     || $fruit_lc eq 'blackberry' || $fruit_lc eq 'loganberry' )
</ins>{
  print "Berry...\n";
<ins>  if ( $fruit_lc ne 'loganberry' )
</ins>  {
    print "pie!\n";
  }
}
else
{
  print "Some other kind of fruit!\n";
}
</pre></div></div>
 
   <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it. </p>
 
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE TERMINAL SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~/perl1$ <ins>./fruit_check.pl</ins>
Citrus... juicy!    
cold:~/perl1$ 
</pre></div></div>
 
   <p>Do you see how that works? By 
    creating <span class="darkblue">$fruit_lc</span> as a lowercase version of <span class="darkblue">$fruit</span>, we can compare it to any lowercase 
    string, such as <span class="orange">'orange'</span>. (It would have worked equally well to use 
    <b>uc()</b> and compare to <span class="orange">'ORANGE'</span>; just make sure you're 
    consistent!)</p>
 
   <p>We didn't use <b>$fruit = lc( $fruit )</b> just in case we want to use the
    <i>original</i> version of <span class="darkred">$fruit</span> to do something else later, like print out in an error message.</p>
 
   <p>Now let's see how to <i>concatenate</i> strings. Concatenation is a technical term that means "join 
    together." You already know one way to join two strings—say <b>$x</b> and <b>$y</b>—together:
    interpolation (<b>"$x$y"</b>). So why do we have another way of doing it?  Well, Perl is all 
    about choice—remember the Perl maxim, "There's more than one way to do it." Sometimes, concatenation 
    makes code easier to read and/or more logical than interpolation. Here's how we'd concatenate 
    <b>$x</b> and <b>$y</b>:</p>
 
   <div class="c"><p><b>$x . $y</b></p></div> 
 
   <p>See that dot in between <b>$x</b> and <b>$y</b>? That's the concatenation operator. The result 
    of the expression above is the two variables (stringified if one of them is a 
    number) joined together.</p>
 
   <p>Here's a great reason to use the concatenation operator. Say you're constructing a really long 
    string to print as part of a report: </p>

   <div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE:</div><div class="observe"><pre>
<span class="darkred">$title</span> = <span class="orange">"Observations on the Mating Habits of $bird with Special Reference to Nesting Behavior Documented in $country"</span>;
</pre></div></div>
 
   <p>That's a very wide line, longer than most best practices of 72 characters, and far too long if 
    you're using it in a magazine article, for instance. The concatenation operator comes to the 
    rescue:</p>
   
   <div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE:</div><div class="observe"><pre>
<span class="darkred">$title</span> = <span class="orange">"Observations on the Mating Habits of $bird"</span>
        . <span class="orange">" with Special Reference to Nesting Behavior"</span>
        . <span class="orange">" Documented in $country"</span>;
</pre></div></div>
 
   <p>Now we can break the line up any way we please. </p>
 
   <p>Okay, now suppose we're printing <b>$title</b> in a report and we need to know whether it will fit on 
    the output line. How can we tell, when the value of <b>$bird</b> could be anything from 
    "Auk" to "Himalayan Golden Backed Three-Toed Woodpecker"? This is where the 
    <b>length</b> function comes in handy. It tells us how many characters are in a 
    string:</p>
 
   <div class="c"><p><b>length</b>( "Auk" ) == 3   # True!</p></div> 
 
   <table class="noteBox pBox "><tr><td class="noteTitle">WARNING</td><td class="note">For the purposes of our discussions in this course, we're dealing only with characters 
    in the ASCII set and therefore "character" is synonymous with "byte."  That is not true when 
    dealing with Unicode—an extended character set capable of expressing just about every character 
    in just about every language—but that's outside the scope of this course.</td></tr></table>
 
   <p>Here's another way we might use the length function. It can check to see whether a variable 
    looks like a US zip code. Create <b>zip_check.pl</b> and enter the code as shown:</p>
 
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE:</div><div class="listing"><pre><ins>#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

my $zip;
$zip = "98362";

if ( length( $zip ) == 5 )
{
  print "$zip could be a standard zip code\n";
}
elsif ( length( $zip ) == 9 || length( $zip ) == 10 )  # May have hyphen between parts
{
  print "$zip could be a ZIP+4 code\n"; 
}
else
{
  die "$zip is not a zip code\n";
}</ins>
</pre></div></div>
 
   <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it. </p>
   
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE TERMINAL SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~/perl1$ <ins>./zip_check.pl</ins>
98362 could be a standard zip code    
cold:~/perl1$ 
</pre></div></div>
 
   <p>Try setting <span class="darkblue">$zip</span> to 
    <b>"4077"</b>, <b>"12345-1234"</b>, and <b>"hedgehogs"</b> and rerun it after each change. You can 
    see that the check isn't perfect, but it's a start.</p> 
  
   <p>We put the zip code in a string, now let's see what happens when you change it to a number, for instance 
    <b>95472</b> (O'Reilly's west coast office zip code). 
    Now try the number <b>04401</b> (the zip code for Bangor, Maine). Look closely at the output.  
    What's odd about it? Try the number <b>02138</b> (O'Reilly's east coast office zip code). Remember—don't 
    put quotes around a number!
    What happens?</p>
 
   <p>You've just learned how to input numbers in a different <i>radix</i> or <i>base</i>—in this case, 
    <i>octal</i> (base 8). For more information, check out <b>perldoc perldata</b> or 
    <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/perldata.html" target="_blank">http://perldoc.perl.org/perldata.html</a>, particularly the section titled "Scalar value 
    constructors." Try changing <span class="darkblue">$zip</span> to numbers like <b>0xface0ff</b> and 
    <b>0b11001001</b>—again (remember, in Perl there are no quotation marks around numbers). See what gets printed 
    and make sure you understand the reasons behind it. Then, 
    put quotation marks around those values—<b>"0xface0ff"</b> and <b>"0b11001001"</b>—and see what happens. 
    Change those values until you're confident that you understand the difference between a string and a 
    number.</p>

   <p>I'm feeling confident in your progress so far. Good job! 
   It may feel like we're learning Perl slowly—and indeed we are taking baby steps—but by 
   taking time to understand the fundamentals, we'll have a strong 
    foundation to build upon. When people don't learn these fundamentals well, they end up writing only 
    "cargo cult code"—code assembled by copying and pasting from other people's examples, 
    then hoping for the best.</p>
