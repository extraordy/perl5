# OST-Perl-Programming-Certificate
O'Reilly School Of Technology Perl Programming Certificate Objectives and Solutions

The Oâ€™Reilly School of Technology is now closed (RIP - January 31, 2016), but I was among the last lucky ones who were able to finish their certificate program in time before the shutdown. This repository contains all of the course objectives and my associated  solutions.

If you are interested in learning Perl 5, you can actually use the same curriculum, as it is licensed under the Creative Commons Attributions-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported licence (briefly, you are free to share and adapt the course materials for any purpose, even commercially) and is still available on the web: : 

Perl 1: Introduction to Perl  

Perl 2: Intermediate Perl 

Perl 3: Advanced Perl  

Perl 4: Applied Perl 

The OST Perl Programming certificate series comprised these four courses from a beginner to an advanced level - a total of 240 Clock Hours or 16 Continuing Education Units. The author of this program is Peter Scott (Perl Debugged, Perl Medic) - whom I hold in high estimation and consider him one of the greatest Perl evangelists -, who has been teaching Perl for over a dozen years. I chose this certificate program to reassess and systematize my Perl knowledge with a user-active approach, learning and recapping by doing.

Paul ReFalo (Portland, OR) was my instructor, who did a great job by motivating me, his knowledge and strong support, great sense of humor helped me a lot to nail this program.   

If someone would also like to have the quiz questions ans answers sorted by lessons, please let me know and - depending on my availability - I'll extend the repository with those, as well.

Enjoy!
