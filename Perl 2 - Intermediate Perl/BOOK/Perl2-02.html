  <p>Welcome to lesson two! In this lesson, we'll look at how to open specific files by a much more efficient 
   mechanism than naming them on the command line or playing games with <span class="red">@ARGV</span>. But first, we'll see 
   how there is yet another way to express a conditional statement (don't worry, this is directly related to 
   this lesson's topic, as you will soon see).</p>
  
  <a name="h_01"></a><div class="heading">Yet Another Conditional</div><div class="headingText">
      
   <p>As we discussed in the last lesson, the postfixed conditional modifiers may <i>look</i> like they're 
    the wrong way around, but they really aren't; and sometimes we talk that way anyway ("Make me a sandwich, 
    if you have the time"), so postfixed modifiers can be a natural way of expressing yourself in Perl.</p>
   
   <p>But if you still don't like the look of clauses in that order, you don't have to use postfixed 
    modifiers. Remember Perl's motto: "There's More Than One Way To Do 
    It" (TMTOWTDI).  There is a <i>third</i> option.  Remember the <span class="blue">&amp;&amp;</span> operator, meaning
    "and"? </p>

   <p>Let's investigate; create <span class="darkred">test_and.pl</span> as shown:</p>
   
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE: test_and.pl</div><div class="listing"><pre><ins>#!/usr/bin/perl

}

{
  print "Don't expect to see this either\n";
}

<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE TERMINAL SESSION</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~$ <ins>cd perl2</ins>
cold:~/perl2$ <ins>./test_and.pl</ins>                                                                                                                                                        
Failed conditional
cold:~/perl2$
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p>Perl didn't even <i>call</i> the <span class="darkgreen">item_test</span> subroutine to find out its 
    value—it didn't need to know!</p>
   
   <p>We call this <i>short-circuiting</i>; Perl does not evaluate the right side if it would make no 
    difference to the result of the expression. If <span class="red">$count</span> is not less than 1, the result of  
    <span class="darkgreen">item_test()</span> is irrelevant, so Perl saves time and doesn't bother; it just returns 
    false as the result of the whole expression straight away.</p>

   <p>Short-circuiting causes <span class="blue">&amp;&amp;</span> to behave just the same as an <span class="purple">if</span> 
    statement would; if the left side (condition) is true, then evaluate the right side (conditionally executed 
    block). Even though Perl computes a value for the <span class="blue">&amp;&amp;</span> expression, we don't have to 
    use it. So we could write our postfixed example from the previous lesson as: </p>
    
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: &amp;&amp; for control flow</div><div class="observe"><pre>
<span class="red">$car_type</span> eq <span class="orange">'hybrid'</span> <span class="blue">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="darkgreen">print</span> <span class="orange">"Check remaining battery life\n"</span>;
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p>How about that! But there is one change we should consider. There's 
    another form of the <span class="blue">&amp;&amp;</span> operator that means <i>exactly</i> the same thing: <span class="blue">and</span>. 
    The change might seem insignificant at first, but there is a crucial 
    difference between the two options here. The <span class="blue">&amp;&amp;</span> operator has a relatively 
    high <i>precedence</i>, which means that 
    Perl will evaluate the <span class="blue">&amp;&amp;</span> operator before many other operators in an expression. 
    (Precedence is the reason that <span class="blue">4 + 5 * 3</span> evaluates to 19 rather than 27; the 
    <span class="blue">*</span> has a higher precedence than the <span class="blue">+</span> and hence <span class="blue">5 * 3</span> is computed 
    before <span class="blue">4 +</span>.)</p>
   
   <p>But the <span class="blue">and</span> operator has a very <i>low</i> precedence. In fact, nothing comes lower than 
    <span class="blue">and</span>. So we'll want to use <span class="blue">and</span> instead of <span class="blue">&amp;&amp;</span> to 
     control flow (that is, as an alternative to an <span class="purple">if</span> statement), otherwise we 
    could get into trouble. Suppose we were writing an <span class="blue">&amp;&amp;</span> version of this statement:</p>
   
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: if example</div><div class="observe"><pre>
<span class="purple">if</span> ( <span class="darkgreen">length</span> <span class="red">$title</span> &gt; 1 )
{
  <span class="red">$print_title</span> = <span class="red">$TRUE</span>;
}
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p>If we write that as: </p>
   
   <div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: &amp;&amp; example</div><div class="observe"><pre>
<span class="darkgreen">length</span> <span class="red">$title</span> &gt; 1 <span class="blue">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="red">$print_title</span> = <span class="red">$TRUE</span>;
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p>...we get a compilation error. Try it now to see what the error is; create <span class="darkred">and_error.pl</span> as shown:</p>

<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE: and_error.pl</div><div class="listing"><pre><ins>#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

my $TRUE = 1;
my $title = "Intermediate Perl";
my $print_title;

length $title &gt; 1 &amp;&amp; $print_title = $TRUE;</ins>
</pre></div></div>
    
   <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG">, saving it in your <b>/perl2</b> folder as 
    <b>and_error.pl</b>:</p> 
   
   <p><div class="c"><img src="images/lessonImages/and_error_debug1.png"></div></p>
   
   <p>The problem lies in the high 
    precedence of <span class="blue">&amp;&amp;</span>. (Of course, we could fix that problem by putting in parentheses, 
    but if you follow the rule you're about to learn, you won't have to.) Modify <b>and_error.pl</b> as 
    shown:</p>
   
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO EDIT: and_error.pl</div><div class="listing"><pre>#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

my $TRUE = 1;
my $title = "Intermediate Perl";
my $print_title;

length $title &gt; 1 <ins>and</ins> $print_title = $TRUE;
</pre></div></div>
    
   <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> again. Everything is fine now, because <ins>and</ins> 
    gets evaluated "late." Now you can write the original example like this: </p>
    
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: and instead of postfixed if</div><div class="observe"><pre>
<span class="red">$car_type</span> eq <span class="orange">'hybrid'</span> <span class="blue">and</span><span class="darkgreen"> print</span> <span class="orange">"Check remaining battery life\n"</span>;
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p>The rule of thumb is, use <span class="blue">&amp;&amp;</span> and <span class="blue">||</span> in expressions (where a value is 
    being calculated); use <span class="blue">and</span> and <span class="blue">or</span> for changing control flow (that is, instead 
    of lengthier forms of <span class="purple">if</span> and <span class="purple">unless</span>).</p>
   
   
   <p>To find out more about precedence, run <b>perldoc perlop</b> and look at the table in the section on 
    Operator Precedence and Associativity.</p>

   <p>"You cannot open a book without learning something." -Confucius</p>
   
   <p>Now we'll look at how to open a file. This is an important topic. Virtually every 
    program of any utility will require that you read information into it from some source and write 
    information from it to some destination. The function in Perl that lets us do both is 
    called <span class="darkgreen">open()</span>.  I recommend that you do <i>not</i> read the <b>perldoc -f</b> 
    documentation on <span class="darkgreen">open()</span> yet, because it could confuse and overwhelm you.
    <span class="darkgreen">open()</span> can be used for opening things other than files, and for opening things 
    in multiple ways; the <b>perldoc -f</b> documentation covers <i>all</i> of them. Save that documentation 
    for another time. 
    The 
    appropriate documentation section to read for this lesson is <b>perldoc perlopentut</b>.</p>
   
   <H4>Filehandles</H4>
   
   <p>Think about what it takes to read from a file. Every time you ask for more input, Perl has to know 
    where it left off. Perl also has to remember other, more esoteric, information to do with things like 
    buffers and such. You don't want to bother with all of that; you just want to get input. The way Perl 
    remembers everything that it has to know, without bothering us with it, is to hide it all 
    behind something called a <i>filehandle</i>. 
    A filehandle <i>looks</i> like a scalar, but you can't do the usual scalar-ish kinds of things with it 
    (well, you can try, but the results won't be helpful); you can only use it in file reading operations.</p>
   
   <p>The same is true for outputting to a file, so we use filehandles for that as well. We create a 
    filehandle with <span class="darkgreen">open()</span>. There's another important reason 
    for using 
   <span class="darkgreen">open()</span>; it gives us a convenient way to find out whether we're 
    going to be successful at our task. If we're going to read from a file, we ought to find 
    out first of all whether it exists. But suppose we checked for that, got the answer "yes," and then went 
    to read from the file, but in between those two operations, someone deleted the file? Hmm. Fortunately,  
    <span class="darkgreen">open()</span> acts as a kind of contract with the computer; if it is successful, 
    you won't have to worry about someone deleting the file, because you got there first, and you'll be able 
    to read from the file until you're done. Some operating systems achieve this by telling anyone who tries 
    to delete a file that you've opened, that they're not allowed to delete it; some operating systems do it 
    by deleting the file in name, but letting you continue to read the data from it until you're done, and 
    only then releasing the space the file occupies. With me so far? Good! 
    Similarly, if you're going to be writing to a file, you'd 
    like to know in advance whether you have permission to do so, as that file could be located in a directory 
    you're not allowed to change. </p>
   
   <p>So that's why we have filehandles. We'll make some in a minute. First, let's go over the basic form of 
    <span class="darkgreen">open()</span>:</p>
   
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: generic form of open()</div><div class="observe"><pre>
<i>boolean</i> = <span class="darkgreen">open</span> <i>filehandle, mode, filename</i>
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p>This is called the <i>three-argument</i> version of <span class="darkgreen">open()</span>. 
    There are other forms of the <span class="darkgreen">open()</span> function 
    that have two arguments or even one argument, but we won't be addressing them in depth in this course.
    The three-argument version is best for many reasons, primarily improved security.  
    You'll still see programs using the two-argument form in particular, because that version
    was widely used before the three-argument version became available in 2000. 
    We want to learn current techniques though, so we'll stick to the <i>three-argument</i> version of <span class="darkgreen">open()</span>.</p>
   
   <p><span class="darkgreen">open()</span> is a function like <span class="darkgreen">print()</span>, where we typically
    leave the parentheses off of the arguments. Put the parentheses on if you like, but most people leave them 
    off, most of the time.</p>
   
   <p>Alright then, let's start creating an example and I'll explain it in detail as we go. Create 
    <span class="darkred">make_datafile.pl</span> in your /perl2 folder, as shown:</p>
   
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE: make_datafile.pl</div><div class="listing"><pre><ins>#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

my $DATA_FILE = 'songs.data';

my $fh;
if ( open $fh, '&gt;', $DATA_FILE )
{
  print {$fh} qq{2'02" Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\n};
  print {$fh} qq{2'44" With A Little Help From My Friends\n};
  print {$fh} qq{3'29" Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds\n};
  close $fh;
}
else
{
  die "Couldn't open $DATA_FILE: $!\n";
}</ins>
</pre></div></div>
   <table class="noteBox pBox "><tr><td class="noteTitle">Note</td><td class="note">
    Those curly braces around <span class="red">$fh</span> in the <b>print</b> statements are not typos!  There's something unusual going on
    there that we'll explain fully later on.
   </td></tr></table>
   <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it. A text file named  
    <span class="darkred">songs.data</span> appears in the folder (type the <b>ls</b> 
    command to list the files there). To see the contents of the file, type this in the Unix shell:</p>
   
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE TERMINAL SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>
cold:~/perl2$ <ins>cat ./songs.data</ins>                                                                                                                                                     
2'02" Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
2'44" With A Little Help From My Friends
3'29" Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds
cold:~/perl2$
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p>Let's take a closer look at this program:</p>
   
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: make_datafile.pl</div><div class="observe"><pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

my $DATA_FILE = 'songs.data';

<span class="blue">my</span> <span class="darkred">$fh</span>;
if ( <span class="darkgreen">open</span> $fh, '&gt;', $DATA_FILE )
{
  print {<span class="darkred">$fh</span>} <span class="darkblue">qq</span><span class="purple">{</span>2'02<span class="orange">"</span> Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\n<span class="purple">}</span>;
  print {<span class="darkred">$fh</span>} <span class="darkblue">qq</span><span class="purple">{</span>2'44<span class="orange">"</span> With A Little Help From My Friends\n<span class="purple">}</span>;
  print {<span class="darkred">$fh</span>} <span class="darkblue">qq</span><span class="purple">{</span>3'29<span class="orange">"</span> Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds\n<span class="purple">}</span>;
  close <span class="darkred">$fh</span>;
}
else
{
  die "Couldn't open $DATA_FILE: $!\n";
}
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p>The <span class="darkblue">qq</span> operator is another way of writing double quotation marks 
    ("<span class="darkblue">qq</span>" is supposed to remind you of that). The character immediately following 
    <span class="darkblue">qq</span> is the delimiter for the string. If it's a left character of a 
    mirrored pair (like <b>()</b>, or <b>&lt;&gt;</b>, <b>{}</b>), the closing delimiter for the string 
    will be the right character. I used it in this example so I wouldn't have to escape the <span class="orange">"</span> 
    character inside each string.</p>
   
   <p>A filehandle is a scalar, but it's different from scalars we've encountered before. 
    It's not a number or a string. You can't do anything with it except use it to read from files 
    opened for reading or write to files opened for writing. Trying to increment one is pointless. The 
    <span class="darkgreen">open()</span> call will <i>assign</i> to the filehandle even though it's one of the 
    arguments to <span class="darkgreen">open()</span> (that's okay though; you can write subroutines that overwrite 
    their arguments, although it's not usually good style). In our example, we've created the filehandle 
    <span class="darkred">$fh</span>.</p>
   
   <p>A filehandle should be a <i>lexical variable</i> (one you declared with <span class="blue">my</span>) that is 
    undefined. You can make sure of that and save a line of code at the same time by declaring the 
    filehandle <i>inside</i> the <span class="darkgreen">open()</span> call! This looks weird at first, but 
    you can put <span class="blue">my</span> before the first appearance of a variable just about anywhere, 
    not just on a line by itself.  Let's try that. Modify <span class="darkred">make_datafile.pl</span> as shown:</p>
 
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO EDIT: make_datafile.pl</div><div class="listing"><pre>

   <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it, and <b>cat ./songs.data</b> again. 
    The previous data file was overwritten (with the same contents, plus the track we added). 
    Here's what we did:</p>

  close $fh;

else
{
  <span class="blue">die</span> "Couldn't open $DATA_FILE: <span class="red">$!</span>\n";
}   
</pre></div></div>
      
   <p>We collapsed all the <span class="darkgreen">print</span> statements into a single one, using a heredoc 
    (<span class="darkred">&lt;&lt;</span>).</p> 
   
   <p>The result of the <span class="darkgreen">open()</span> call is true if the file 
    can be opened successfully. In this case, the file songs.data is opened for output (that's what the second 
    parameter, the string <span class="orange">'&gt;'</span> means; we'll see how to do input shortly). The third 
    parameter (<span class="darkblue">$DATA_FILE</span>) refers to the file name.</p>
   
   <p>I said I'd explain the curly braces around <span class="purple">{$fh}</span> in the <b>print</b> statements.
    The way we output to a filehandle (and it must be one that is open for writing, not reading, or we'll 
    get an error message) is with the print statement. But because print sends everything to the standard 
    output by default (technically, it sends it to the currently selected filehandle, which by default is the 
    standard output), there must be a way to tell print to use a different filehandle. We do that with a 
    special "argument," which is the filehandle inside curly braces (<span class="purple">{$fh}</span>). It's not an 
    argument in the usual sense, because there's <i>no comma</i> after it; if you add a comma by mistake, Perl 
    will just turn the filehandle into a (funny-looking) string and print it to the standard output. The 
    braces are optional, by the way, but it's a best practice for readability to use them, so we always 
    will. </p>
   
   <p>The <span class="red">$!</span> variable is a special variable in Perl, like <span class="red">@ARGV</span>. If an 
    <span class="darkgreen">open()</span> call fails (returns false), <span class="red">$!</span> is set to the text of the reason 
    for the failure.</p>
   
   <p>We'll almost always want to call <span class="blue">die</span> when an <span class="darkgreen">open()</span> call fails; 
    few programs can keep going constructively after being unable to open a file. You saw in the last 
    lesson how to collapse a whole <b>elsif</b> clause using the <b>and</b> form of conditional when the 
    statement in the block caused a change of control flow. We can do the same in this 
    program. Modify <b>make_datafile.pl</b> as shown:</p>

   <p>We can do one more thing to make this program more concise. The <span class="darkgreen">close()</span> function 
    is the converse of <span class="darkgreen">open()</span> (read the <b>perldoc -f</b> 
    documentation on it if you like). As its name suggests, <span class="darkgreen">close()</span> 
    causes the file to close; you can no longer use the 
    filehandle without getting an error message. In particular, all pending output to files opened for writing 
    is flushed. (If you look at an output file as it's being written by another program running at the same 
    time, you probably won't see the output show up until some time after the program has printed it. It's 
    buffered by Perl or the operating system and written in chunks to improve efficiency.)</p>
    
   <p>If the lexical variable holding the filehandle is destroyed, Perl calls <span class="darkgreen">close()</span> 
    right then and we don't need to call it explicitly. (After all, if the filehandle is no longer available 
    to your program, you can't do anything more with it.) We can cause a lexical variable to be destroyed by 
    limiting its scope. This is a good use for a naked block. Modify <span class="darkred">make_datafile.pl</span> as 
    shown:</p>
      
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO EDIT: make_datafile.pl</div><div class="listing"><pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

my $DATA_FILE = 'songs.data';

<ins>{
  open my $fh, '&gt;', $DATA_FILE or die "Couldn't open $DATA_FILE: $!\n";</ins>
  print {$fh} &lt;&lt;'EOF';

<ins>}</ins>
<del>close $fh;</del></pre></div></div>

   <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it, and <b>cat ./songs.data</b>. Once 
    again, the output is the same except for the new track. In this example, that makes no difference 
    technically, because the program ends at that point and all open filehandles are closed upon program exit 
    anyway. But it's still a good practice to limit the scope of a filehandle the same way you'd limit the scope of 
    any other variable.</p>
   
   <p>Every time you open a file, you should check to see whether the <span class="darkgreen">open()</span> succeeded. 
    Every Perl programmer does this using <b>open ... or die ...</b>. So as you can see, the third 
    alternative form of conditional syntax (... and/or ...) is part of what is likely the most common idiom in Perl.</p>
   
   <p>Let's see what happens if the <span class="darkgreen">open()</span> fails. At the Unix shell prompt, type the 
    command shown:</p>
   
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE TERMINAL SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>
cold:~/perl2$ <ins>chmod -w ./songs.data</ins>
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p>Now <img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it and see what happens.</p>

   <p>To change the rights back, type:</p>
   
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE TERMINAL SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>

  <a name="h_03"></a><div class="heading">Reading from filehandles</div><div class="headingText">

   <p>In the Perl 1 course, we discovered the <span class="blue">&lt;&gt;</span> operator, which reads from files named in 
    <span class="red">@ARGV</span>. But guess what? That's actually a <i>special case</i> of something more general that we'll learn about now. 
    We'll write another program that will read the <span class="darkred">songs.data</span> 
    file and total the song lengths. Let's call this one <span class="darkred">read_datafile.pl</span>. Type the code below as shown:</p>
   
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE: read_datafile.pl</div><div class="listing"><pre><ins>#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

my $DATA_FILE = 'songs.data';

open my $fh, '&lt;', $DATA_FILE or die "Couldn't open $DATA_FILE: $!\n";
while ( my $line = &lt;$fh&gt; )
{
  chomp $line;
  my $minute_pos = index $line, "'";
  my $second_pos = index $line, '"';
  my $minutes = substr $line, 0, $minute_pos;
  my $seconds = substr $line, $minute_pos + 1, $second_pos - $minute_pos - 1;
  my $running_time = $minutes + $seconds / 60;
  my $title = substr $line, $second_pos + 2;
  print "$title lasts $running_time minutes\n";
}
</ins></pre></div></div>
   
   <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it. Now let's take a closer look:</p>
   
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: read_datafile.pl</div><div class="observe"><pre>#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

my $DATA_FILE = 'songs.data';

open my $fh, '&lt;', $DATA_FILE or die "Couldn't open $DATA_FILE: $!\n";
<span class="purple">while</span> ( my $line = <span class="darkblue">&lt;<span class="darkred">$fh</span>&gt;</span> )
{
  chomp $line;
  my $minute_pos = index $line, "'";
  my $second_pos = index $line, '"';
  my $minutes = substr $line, 0, $minute_pos;
  my $seconds = substr $line, $minute_pos + 1, $second_pos - $minute_pos - 1;
  my $running_time = $minutes + $seconds / 60;
  my $title = substr $line, $second_pos + 2;
  print "$title lasts $running_time minutes\n";
}
</pre></div></div>   
   
   <p>The <span class="darkblue">&lt;&gt;</span> operator (which we call the <i>readline</i> operator) in this program 
    is taking an argument, namely, <span class="darkred">$fh</span>.  It works just like the empty form of 
    <span class="blue">&lt;&gt;</span>, only without the magical behavior of opening successive files named on the command 
    line. It returns the next line from the filehandle <span class="darkred">$fh</span> in a scalar context, and all of 
    the remaining lines in a list context.</p>
   
   <p>If you took the Perl 1 course and you've been paying exceptionally close attention, you may wonder why 
    the <span class="purple">while</span> line does not wrap the condition in a <span class="darkgreen">defined</span> test. 
    Isn't this asking for trouble, if the file contains a line with a string value that would be false? Granted, 
    there is only one such possible value—a line containing precisely the character 0 (zero) and not 
    even a newline on the end, which means it would have to be the last line in the file, but still, we don't 
    want to miss any possible lines.</p>
   
   <p>In fact, Perl looks at the condition of a <span class="purple">while</span> statement, and if it consists of 
    an assignment from the readline operator, then it <i>wraps the condition in a call to 
     <span class="darkgreen">defined</span> for you.</i>  Pretty helpful, huh? In a few lessons it will get even 
    better!</p>
   
   <p>Also, in this program we had to find the 
    position of the single and double quote marks that mark the end of the minutes and seconds respectively 
    in each line, and figure out how far away from those positions to extract the substrings we needed. (This 
    is necessary because the input data is not in fixed-width columns.) That's clumsy, but there's a better 
    way of doing it that we'll be learning about in this course.</p>
   
   <p>Check out a common error condition now, so you know what it looks like. Delete the file 
    <span class="darkred">songs.data</span> (don't worry, you can get it back any time by rerunning 
    <span class="darkred">make_datafile.pl</span>) and then rerun <span class="darkred">read_datafile.pl</span>. Make sure you get 
    get an error and that you understand it.</p>
  
  </div>
  <a name="h_04"></a><div class="heading">open() modes</div><div class="headingText">

   <p>You've seen that to open a filehandle to read from, you specify a mode of <span class="orange">'&lt;'</span>; and 
    that to open a filehandle to write to, you specify a mode of <span class="orange">'&gt;'</span>.  There are many
    other possible modes, and they are detailed in the <b>perldoc -f open</b> documentation, but be 
    forewarned—most of them are hard to understand and harder still to use correctly. One of the more accessible modes 
    is <i>append</i>, which is denoted by <span class="orange">'&gt;&gt;'</span>. If the file does not already
    exist, it will be created; if it already exists, the output will be added to the end of its current
    contents.</p>
    
   <p>Let's give that a test by modifying <b>make_datafile.pl</b> as shown:</p>
    
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO EDIT: make_datafile.pl</div><div class="listing"><pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl

use warnings;

my $DATA_FILE = 'songs.data';

  print {$fh} &lt;&lt;'EOF';
