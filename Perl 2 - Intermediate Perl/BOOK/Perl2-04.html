   <p>"The way is long if one follows precepts, but short... if one follows patterns."&gt;<br> 
    -Lucius Annaeus Seneca (4 BC - 65 AD)</p>
   
   <p>In this lesson we'll learn about one of the most important fundamental operations in Perl—<i>regular 
    expressions</i>. "Perl" doesn't actually officially 
    stand for anything, it's not an acronym. That's why it's not written as "PERL". Though Perl's author, Larry Wall, did 
    once suggest using the acronym "Practical 
    Extraction and Reporting Language." That acronym fits with Perl's reputation for being 
    a great language for parsing and manipulating text and unstructured data. In that 
    respect, the regular expression in Perl and how well it is integrated into the rest of the language, is crucial.</p>
   
   <p>First of all, don't let the phrase "regular expression" scare you. The term was invented by 
    mathematicians before computers ever existed. We may be stuck with the label but not with 
    the dry mathematical theory. We'll leave that part out of our discussion of regular expressions and explain them in 
    such a way that mortals without math degrees can understand.</p>
   
   <p>Secondly, in the same way that mathematicians and physicists like to create formulas where every character stands
    for something different, like <b>E = mc<sup>2</sup></b>, regular expressions are their
    own separate language, where every character represents something. You write what amounts to a little program in 
    the regular expression language, which gets embedded in a Perl program, and when Perl runs it, it fires up 
    the <i>regular expression engine</i> to decipher and run your regular expressions.</p>
   
   <p>But what do regular expressions <i>do?</i> They're used to find patterns in text. You can also 
    use them to find patterns in general data that you wouldn't consider text, but it's easier to talk 
    about regular expressions in terms of parsing text; that's mostly what they're used for anyway.</p>
   
   <p>Speaking of simplifying our discussion, "regular expressions" is a bit of a mouthful. Since we're 
    going to use the term over and over, we'll use the common contraction <i>regex</i>.</p>
   
   <p>We'll start out with tasks like determining whether the string "apple" 
    occurs in the text, or whether there's a vowel or a telephone number in it. Later, we'll look at more 
    complicated examples. The regex language includes more features than we will cover in this course, 
    and more than one book has been written just on that language. With all of those powerful features, the 
    regex language can even be used to parse programs written in languages as complicated as Perl.</p>

   <p>Let's get started with the basic type of regex, and see how to embed it in a Perl program. 
    Create <b>reg_literal.pl</b> as shown:</p>
   
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE : reg_literal.pl</div><div class="listing"><pre><ins>#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

my $text = "I have three apples and four oranges";
$text =~ /apple/ and print "Found an apple\n";

$text = "I have two tomatoes and one zucchini";
$text =~ /apple/ or print "Didn't find an apple\n";</ins>
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it.</p> 
   
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE TERMINAL SESSION</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~$ <ins>cd perl2</ins>
cold:~/perl2$ <ins>./reg_literal.pl</ins>
Found an apple
Didn't find an apple
cold:~/perl2$ 
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p>Our program found an apple in the first string we put in <span class="darkblue">$text</span> ("I have three <b>apple</b>s 
    and four oranges") and didn't find an apple in the second string we put in <span class="darkblue">$text</span> ("I 
    have two tomatoes and one zucchini").</p>
   
    <p>Let's take a closer look at this program:</p> 
   
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: reg_literal.pl</div><div class="observe"><pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

my $text = "I have three apples and four oranges";
$text =~ /apple/ <span class="purple">and</span> print "Found an apple\n";

$text = "I have two tomatoes and one zucchini";
<span class="red">$text</span> <span class="darkred">=~</span> <span class="darkblue">/apple/</span> <span class="purple">or</span> print "Didn't find an apple\n";
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p>See how we used <span class="purple">and</span> to mean <i>if</i> and <span class="purple">or</span> to mean <i>unless</i>?</p>
   
   <p>Now, imagine that Perl has a function named say, <span class="darkgreen">regmatch()</span>, that returns true or 
    false, and it works like this: </p>
   
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: hypothetical regmatch() example</div><div class="observe"><pre>
if ( <span class="darkred">regmatch</span>( '<span class="darkblue">apple</span>', <span class="red">$text</span> ) )
{
  # ...
}
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p>The regex would be in the first argument, and the string to match it against would be in the second 
    one. That makes sense, right? Many languages implement regular expressions just like this. Perl, 
    however, introduces new syntax so that regexes can appear in the code without the clutter of words like 
    "regmatch" making it hard to read. That funny expression breaks down like this:</p>
      
   <p><div class="c"><img src="images/lessonImages/regmatch.png"></div></p>
   
   <p>The <span class="blue">/apple/</span> is the regex, and the <span class="darkred">=~</span> is the <i>binding 
    operator</i>, which tells Perl that the regex is to be tested against whatever appears to the left of it,
    in this case, <span class="red">$text</span>. It looks like some sort of assignment because of the equals sign, but 
    trust me, there's no assignment going on. <span class="darkred">=~</span> simply means, "I have a regex to my right
    which is to be matched against the string to my left, and the value of the whole expression <b>STRING =~ 
     REGEX</b> is true if the regex matched the string, and false if it didn't."</p>
   
   <p><div class="c"><table class="noteBox fBox pBox "><tr><td class="noteTitle">WARNING</td><td class="note">There is no actual <span class="darkgreen">regmatch</span> function in Perl! I made that up 
    as a hypothetical equivalent to the new syntax for the sake of explanation.</td></tr></table></div></p>
      
   <p>To be ruthlessly precise, technically the regular expression is <span class="blue">apple</span>. The slashes are
    delimiters <i>around</i> the regular expression. But even with the power of font coloring at our 
    disposal, it's still awkward to refer to a regex in documentation without delimiters around it; 
    without them, readers would have a hard time separating the regex (which usually contains punctuation) from 
    the surrounding text. So now when I refer to "the regular expression, 
    <span class="blue">/apple/</span>," I trust that you understand that the regex itself is located between the slashes.</p>

   <p>Now, what if we want to match a slash? Modify reg_literal.pl as shown:</p>
   
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO EDIT: reg_literal.pl</div><div class="listing"><pre>#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

my $text = "I have three apples<ins>/</ins>four oranges";
$text =~ /apple<ins>s/</ins>/ and print "Found apple<ins>s/</ins>\n";

$text = "I have two tomatoes and one zucchini";
$text =~ /apple/ or print "Didn't find an apple\n";
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG">, and you get compilation errors. Because the slash is 
    treated as a delimiter, you can't match on it as well.</p> 
   
   <p>You can use different delimiters if you like, delimiters that follow the same rules as 
    <span class="darkgreen">qq</span>, but if you do, you <i>must</i> prefix the first delimiter with the letter 
    <span class="orange">m</span>. Modify <span class="darkred">reg_literal.pl</span> and see this for yourself:</p>
 
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO EDIT: reg_literal.pl</div><div class="listing"><pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

my $text = "I have three apples/four oranges";
$text =~ <ins>m!</ins>apples/<ins>!</ins> and print "Found apples<del>/</del>\n";

$text = "I have two tomatoes and one zucchini";
$text =~ <ins>m(</ins>apple<ins>)</ins> or print "Didn't find an apple\n";
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it.</p>
    
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~/perl2$ <ins>./reg_literal.pl</ins>

    <p>This alternate syntax is useful when a regular expression contains a slash; using this approach, 
     the slash does not need to be escaped.</p>
  
  </div>
  <a name="h_03"></a><div class="heading">Structure and Execution of Regular Expressions</div><div class="headingText">
   
   <p>
    Now that you've seen a basic example, let's deconstruct it. Remember I said that in a regular expression, 
    every character had a meaning? Most characters—the vast majority—mean something very simple: 
    "Match this character." That's what <span class="blue">/apple/</span> means: "Match an <span class="blue">a</span>, then match a 
    <span class="blue">p</span>, then match another <span class="blue">p</span>, then match an <span class="blue">l</span>, then match an 
    <span class="blue">e</span>."  You might be tempted to think that this explanation is overkill, and 
    I could just have said it means, "Match <span class="blue">apple</span>." But it's <i>good</i> to be meticulous when 
    explaining how regular expressions work. If you're going to be a great Perl programmer, you need to learn 
    the basic rules of regexes inside and out.</p>
   
   <p>So <span class="blue">/apple/</span> causes Perl to look in the string that is bound to the regex via 
    <span class="darkred">=~</span> first for an <span class="blue">a</span>, scanning each character in the string from left to 
    right (beginning to end), until it finds an <span class="blue">a</span>.  Looking at the first test (against the string 
    <span class="blue">"I have three apples and four oranges"</span>), the regex engine finds one when it gets to the 
    <span class="blue">a</span> in <span class="blue">have</span>, at which point it declares success on that character, and goes on 
    to the next character in the regex, which says that the next thing in the string must be a <span class="blue">p</span>. 
    But it isn't. So Perl <i>undoes</i> the match of the <span class="blue">a</span> (this action is known as 
    <b>backtracking</b>), and moves forward through the string again, looking for another <span class="blue">a</span>. When 
    it next finds one (in <span class="blue">apples</span>), it tests each succeeding character in the regex against the 
    next character in the string, and if each of them match in turn, Perl gets to the end of the regex, and 
    is able to return a true value from the expression.</p>
   
   <p>Some characters do not match literally in regexes, which make regexes even more interesting and 
    powerful. Such characters are known as <i>regex metacharacters</i>:</p>
   
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: Regex Metacharacters</div><div class="observe"><pre>
* ( ) + [ ] { } | . ? ^
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p>If you want to match any of those literally, you have to escape them with a backslash. You'll learn what 
    they do later, but for now, look at that list closely, and remember that those 
    characters are special. In addition to those characters, the <b>$</b> character has special meaning when 
    it's the last character of a regular expression. A regex is like a double-quoted string, so variables 
    interpolate within it. So a <b>$</b> that <i>isn't</i> at the end of the regex is assumed to be the 
    start of a scalar variable, and an <b>@</b> is assumed to be the start of an array variable.</p>
   
   <p>A slash (<b>/</b>) character in the middle of a regex needs to be escaped with a backslash (<b>\</b>) if 
    the regex delimiter is a slash. Otherwise, backslashes obey the same rules that they do in double-quoted 
    strings, with a few exceptions that we will discuss later.</p>
   
   <p>That information dump about metacharacters was for those of you who like to know the rules up front. If 
    you're fretting about how to remember all of that, relax; we'll do plenty of examples with 
    explanations to make sure that you get (and keep) all of it.</p>
  
  </div>
  <a name="h_04"></a><div class="heading">The /i Modifier</div><div class="headingText">
   
   <p>So far, we haven't done anything with regular expressions that couldn't be done with the 
    <span class="darkgreen">index()</span> function. That's about to change. Certain letters typed in <i>after</i> 
    a regex (after the last slash or delimiter) are called <i>modifiers</i> because they 
    modify how the regex engine interprets the regex. The first modifier we'll look at is the <b>/i</b> modifier. 
    (Technically, it's the <b>i</b> modifier; the <b>/</b> is the 
    delimiter, but we'll stick 
    with the convention and call it the <b>/i</b> modifier.)</p>
   
   <p>The <b>i</b> modifier tells the regex engine to <b>i</b>gnore the case of letters in the regex. So 
    <b>/apple/i</b> will still match <span class="blue">"apple"</span>, but will also match <span class="blue">"APPLE"</span>, 
    <span class="blue">"Apple"</span>, <span class="blue">"ApPlE"</span> and all the other combinations of upper and lower case.</p>
   
   <p>Another reason we usually write regexes with the delimiters around them here is to make it clear that we are 
    applying a modifier like <b>/i</b> to the regex. (There is, in 
    fact, a way to place something <i>between</i> the slashes that has the same effect as <b>/i</b>, but it is so 
    hideous that I am not going to show it.)</p>
   
   <p>Modify <span class="darkred">reg_literal.pl</span> as shown:</p>
   
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO EDIT: reg_literal.pl</div><div class="listing"><pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

my $text = "<ins>I HAVE THREE APPLES AND FOUR ORANGES</ins>"; 
$text =~ <ins>/</ins>apple<ins>/i</ins> and print "Found an apple\n";
    
$text = "I have two tomatoes and one zucchini";
$text =~ <ins>m{</ins>apple<ins>}i</ins> or print "Didn't find an apple\n";
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it. Look over the use and effect of a 
    modifier with the default delimiters and different delimiters.</p>
   <p>
    That program didn't require the use of <span class="blue">{}</span> alternate delimiter syntax, but some programmers 
    do so routinely because they like the way it looks.  The alternate delimiter syntax is handy when your regex contains
    slashes.  Modify <span class="darkred">reg_literal.pl</span> as follows:
   </p>
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO EDIT: reg_literal.pl</div><div class="listing"><pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

my $text = "I HAVE THREE APPLES AND FOUR ORANGES"; 
<del>$text =~ /apple/i and print "Found an apple\n";</del>
<ins>$text =~ /24\/5\/1819/i and print "Found Queen Victoria's birthday\n";</ins>

$text = "I have two tomatoes and one zucchini";
<del>$text =~ m{apple}i or print "Didn't find an apple\n";</del>
<ins>$text =~ m{7/7/1776}i or print "Didn't find American Independence Day\n";</ins>
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p>
    Do you see how using the default delimiters of <span class="blue">//</span> requires escaping slashes inside of the
    regular expression, which makes it harder to read?  We call that <i>leaning toothpick syndrome</i>.

   <p>This program takes, as its first argument, a regular expression. We can interpolate a 
    scalar inside a regex (as I said, a regex behaves like a double-quoted string for the most part); the 
    result is used as the regex. The remaining arguments are used as filenames to open (if we didn't supply 
    any, it would work on standard input). The matching lines are printed. We use the default argument ($_) 
    to print.</p>
