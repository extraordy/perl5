  <p>We'll take a diversion from our discussion of one-liners for the first part of this lesson to discuss
    Perl's substitution operator.  Then we'll go over how it can be used in more one-liners!</p>
  
  <a name="h_01"></a><div class="heading">Substitution</div><div class="headingText">
   
   <p>We've used the <b>substitution operator</b> (<b>s///</b>) in this course already, but without understanding it fully. The 
    <span class="blue">s///</span> operator combines the regular expression matching operator with the ability to 
    change the part of the input that was matched to some double quoted string, all in a minimalist
    syntax. Here's what it looks like:</p>
   
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: Substitution Operator</div><div class="observe"><pre>
s/<i>regex</i>/<i>replacement</i>/
</pre></div></div>

   <p>Just like the match operator, you can use other delimiters if you want; unlike the match operator, the
    <b>s</b> at the beginning cannot be omitted when the delimiter is <b>/</b>. If you want the regex to be 
    case-insensitive, add the <span class="darkblue">/i</span> modifier at the end:</p>
      
   <div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: Substitution Operator</div><div class="observe"><pre>
s/<i>regex</i>/<i>replacement</i><span class="darkblue">/i</span>
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p>So how do you use it? Just like the match operator; either bound to an explicit variable:</p>
   
   <div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: Bound Substitution</div><div class="observe"><pre>
<span class="red">$text</span> =~ <span class="orange">s{cat}{dog}</span><span class="darkred">  # Note use of paired delimiters</span>
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p>...or acting implicitly on <span class="red">$_</span>:</p>
   
   <div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: Substitution on $_</div><div class="observe"><pre>
<span class="orange">s/p(?:oo|[uiea])ddle/fiddle/</span>
</pre></div></div>

  <p>In the end, whatever was matched by the regex between the first set of delimiters, is changed to 
   whatever is between the second set of delimiters. This change takes place in the variable explicitly or 
   it is implicitly bound to the substitution operator; that is, that variable is modified in place. The 
   <i>result</i> of the <b>s///</b> is true if the regex matched. It's false if it didn't.</p>
  
  <p>Okay, let's see it in action! Create <span class="darkred">substitute.pl</span> as shown:</p>
  
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE: substitute.pl</div><div class="listing"><pre><ins>#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

my $date = localtime();
$date =~ s/ (\d\d:\d\d:\d\d)// or die "$date not in expected format!\n";
my $time = $1;
while ( defined( my $line = &lt;DATA&gt; ) )
{
  chomp $line;
  $line =~ s/X_DATE_X/$date/;
  $line =~ s/X_TIME_X/$time/;
  print "$line\n";
}

__END__
The date is X_DATE_X today
and the time is X_TIME_X;
i.e., it is X_TIME_X on X_DATE_X</ins>
</pre></div></div>
  
  <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it. This is actually a common pattern, it's called 
   <i>templating</i>. It looks for special markers in text and turns them into computed values at run-time. 
   I'll walk you through each of the substitutions in this program:</p>
  
  <ul><li><span class="red">$date</span> =~ <span class="orange">s/ (\d\d:\d\d:\d\d)//</span> <br>
    <span class="red">$date</span> is set to the scalar context result of <span class="darkgreen">localtime</span>, which is 
    something of the form <span class="orange">"Day Mon DD HH:MI:SS YYYY"</span>; for example, 
    <span class="orange">Tue May 11 21:41:40 2010</span> (It might be different if you run this on a system with a 
    non-English locale). I want to extract the <span class="orange">HH:MI:SS</span> part and call that the 
    time, and then call the rest of the string in <span class="red">$date</span> after <span class="orange">HH:MI:SS</span> is removed. So 
    the date in this example would be <span class="orange">Tue May 11 2010</span> and the time would be 
    <span class="orange">21:41:40</span>. This first substitution removes the time, including the leading space, from 
    <span class="red">$date</span>. It also saves the time in a capturing parenthesis group—the regex part of a 
    substitution is a proper regex, so if it matches, capturing groups will save to <span class="red">$1</span>, <span class="red">$2</span>, and so on. The 
    next line of code copies <span class="red">$1</span> to <span class="red">$time</span>. (The <span class="darkgreen">die</span> execution 
    path will only be taken if the return from <span class="darkgreen">localtime</span> is incorrect; unlikely, but 
    we always want to follow the good practice of testing for success before using <span class="red">$1</span>.)</li><li><span class="red">$line</span> =~ s<span class="orange">/X_DATE_X/$date/</span> <br>
    Replace <span class="orange">X_DATE_X</span> in <span class="red">$line</span> with the current date.</li><li><span class="red">$line</span> =~ s<span class="orange">/X_TIME_X/$time/</span> <br>
    Replace <span class="orange">X_TIME_X</span> in <span class="red">$line</span> with the current time.</li></ul>
  
  <p>See how variables get interpolated in the replacement string? That string is interpreted as a double-quoted 
   string. Let's do another example. Create <span class="darkred">dedup.pl</span> as shown:</p>
  
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE: dedup.pl</div><div class="listing"><pre><ins>#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

while ( &lt;DATA&gt; )
{
  s/([A-Z]{3})\s+\1/$1/;
  print;

  <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it. It parses a report format with lines 
   that consist of an integer, a floating point number, and then two acronyms, which are sometimes the same. Don't 
   try to figure out what this data means (you won't get far; I made it up!), or why your goal is to eliminate 
   duplicated acronyms from the report; for now, let's just see how this program works.</p>
  
  <p>All of the program's logic is contained within the substitution that takes place on <span class="red">$_</span>. The regex 
   part matches three consecutive uppercase letters (saved into <span class="red">$1</span>), followed by mandatory 
   whitespace, followed by—wait a minute, what's this <span class="orange">\1</span> doing there?</p>
  
  <p><span class="orange">\1</span> tells Perl that you want to match <i>whatever the first capturing group</i>
   just matched (so there'd better be capturing parentheses before that <span class="orange">\1</span>). You can not get that 
   effect in the regex by using <span class="red">$1</span> because <span class="red">$1</span> isn't populated by Perl until the whole 
   regex match has completed. Instead, you would get the <i>previous</i> value of <span class="red">$1</span> (which would 
   be <span class="orange">undef</span> the first time out, but after any successful match and capture, it would be 
   whatever was left over from the last regex). That would be a hard bug to find, so for now, avoid using <span class="red">$1</span> 
   <i>inside a regex</i>.</p>
  
  <p>The replacement string in <span class="blue">s///</span> is not in the regex, so we can use <span class="red">$1</span> 
   there. So our substitution operator reads like this: "Start matching; capture three uppercase letters, then 
   whitespace followed by the same letters, and substitute everything you matched with the letters you 
   captured." That's how we remove duplicates!</p>
  
  </div>
  <a name="h_02"></a><div class="heading">Substitution in One-liners</div><div class="headingText">
   
   <p>The substitution operator is a favorite tool used in one-liners. For instance: </p>

   <div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: s/// one-liner</div><div class="observe"><pre>
<b>perl -nle 's/(\w{3,})\s+\1/$1/;print' <i>input_file...</i></b>
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p>That's a one-liner version of the program <span class="darkred">dedup.pl</span>. Do you see how the
    one-liner helps you save time and work?  Well, hold on, because we can save even more.</p>  
  
  </div>
  <a name="h_03"></a><div class="heading">The -p Flag</div><div class="headingText">
   
   <p>It's so common to want to do a one-liner of the form we just saw—read lines in a loop into 
    <span class="red">$_</span>, do some transformation on <span class="red">$_</span> and then print it—that Perl has a special 
    flag you can use instead of <b>-n</b>; it's
    the <b>-p</b> flag (the "p" stands for "print" and the "n" stands for "no printing").</p>
   
   <p>using <b>-p</b>, our previous one-liner can be shortened further to this:</p>
   
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: -p one-liner</div><div class="observe"><pre>
<b>perl -ple 's/(\w{3,})\s+\1/$1/' <i>input_file...</i></b>
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p>It's really common to transform a text file (or files) by performing a substitution 
    on each line, that's wrapped up in the one-liner with <b>-ple</b> tags. You may think that we've just
    reinvented the <b>sed</b> program, but Perl's regular expressions are a lot more powerful than <b>sed</b>'s. 
    And, if you ever want to add more transformational code using the substitution for extra lines of
    computation, you can do that.</p>

   <p>Try that one-liner right now. Edit <span class="darkred">dedup.pl</span> to extract just the text that comes 
    after the <span class="orange">__END__</span> line into a file named <span class="darkred">./perl2/dup_data.txt</span>, 
    and then run it: </p>
    
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE TERMINAL SESSION</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~$ <ins>cd perl2</ins>
cold:~/perl2$ <ins>perl -ple 's/(\w{3,})\s+\1/$1/' ./dup_data.txt</ins>
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p>To recap, the <b>-p</b> flag assumes a loop of:</p>
   
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: Implicit -p code</div><div class="observe"><pre>
while ( &lt;&gt; )
{
   # <i>code</i>
   print;
}
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p>...around your <b>-e</b> <i>code</i>. It does not work with <b>-n</b>; using both together will result in 
    an error.</p>
  
  </div>
  <a name="h_04"></a><div class="heading">The -i Flag</div><div class="headingText">
   
   <p>In another common scenario, you are given one or more text files and then asked to transform them in some
    way expressed in terms of a substitution, like this: "Take these files and change the date format from MM/DD/YY
    to YYYY-MM-DD," or "Give me a new set of files just like these, but with all the names of the staff
    changed from uppercase to title case," or "Change the name and model number of the product in these
    press releases to the latest version and send them over to marketing."   The task of changing text
    in files comes up so frequently that Perl has a special flag to facilitate it: the <b>-i</b> flag.</p>
   
   <p><b>-i</b> is always used in conjunction with <b>-p</b>; it modifies the destination of 
    <span class="darkgreen">print</span> statements so that they write back to the files you already read from within the 
    <b>-p</b> loop.</p>
   
   <p>That's a lot to wrap your brain around in one go, so let me break it down. The <b>-i</b> flag takes an 
    argument that is an extension used to rename the original files so that you have a backup copy. When our program 
    invokes <b>perl -p -i.bak -e '<i>code</i>' file</b>, it means this: </p>
   <ol><li>Rename file to file.bak.</li><li>Open file.bak for reading.</li><li>Open file for writing.</li><li>For each line in the input:
     <ol><li>Read it into <span class="red">$_</span>.</li><li>Run <i>code</i>.</li><li>Print <span class="red">$_</span> to the output.</li></ol>
    </li><li>Close the input and output files.</li></ol>
   
   <p>And if there are any more files named on the command line, we'd do the same for them as well. (The <b>-i</b> 
    is ignored if there are no files named and input comes from standard input.)</p>
   
   <p>That's a <i>lot</i> of power to pack into a little letter!  And <b>-i</b> has one other trick available: 
    if you don't provide an extension argument for it, then it will modify the input files
    <i>in place,</i>; that is, with no backup.  You need to be really confident in your Perl skills before
    you use that mode.</p>
   
   <p>Let's look at a few examples of the <b>-i</b> flag:</p>
   
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: dos2unix</div><div class="observe"><pre>
<b>perl -pi.bak -e 's/\r\Z//' <i>file...</i></b>
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p>This little gem performs the same function as the Unix program dos2unix: it converts text files that 
    came from a Windows system (where the line separators are, in a Unix Perl terminology, 
    <span class="orange">\r\n</span>) to Unix format (where the line separators are just <span class="orange">\n</span>). To do 
    that, we need to get rid of any <span class="orange">\r</span> that's followed by a <span class="orange">\n</span>. 
    The <span class="orange">\Z</span> anchor is closely related to the one we've seen already: <span class="orange">\z</span>, but 
    where <span class="orange">\z</span> matches the end of the string, <span class="orange">\Z</span> matches the end of the 
    string <b>or</b> a newline (<span class="orange">\n</span>) that is followed by the end of the string.</p>
   
   <p>You can put the <b>-l</b> flag in as well, but it's more common for people to leave it out when using the <b>-i</b> flag. 
    Using <b>-l</b> in this 
    case means that the newline gets stripped off during input and put back in at the end of the implicit
    <span class="darkgreen">print</span> to the output; it's not going to have any effect unless for some
    bizarre reason we put <span class="darkgreen">print()</span> statements in our <b>-e</b> code.</p>
   
   <p>Let's try this example now:</p>
   
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~/perl2$ <ins>perl -pi.bak -e 's/(\w{3,})\s+\1/$1/' dup_data.txt</ins></pre></div></div>
   
   <p>Verify that it has updated <span class="darkred">dup_data.txt</span> and that the original file is in
    <span class="darkred">dup_data.txt.bak</span>. 
   </p>
   
   <p>Often you'll need to do some reformatting. Use <b>wget</b> to copy the <span class="darkred">cd_data</span> 
    file to your /perl folder as shown. Type the code below in the Unix window as shown:</p> 
   
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~/perl2$ <ins>wget "http://courses.oreillyschool.com/Perl2/cd_data"</ins>

   <p>Then, try this example. Type the code below in the Unix window as shown:</p>
   
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~/perl2$ <ins>perl -pi.bak -e 's/\A(\d+)\.\s+/$1:\n\t/' ./cd_data</ins>
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p>That code performs the task of indenting the rest of the information about each track on 
    a line after the track number. Let's try another one. Put the original file back and 
    type the code below in the Unix window as shown:</p>
   
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~/perl2$ <b>mv ./cd_data.bak ./cd_data</b>
cold:~/perl2$ <ins>perl -pi.bak -e 's/\A(\d+)\.\s+(.*)\s+([\d:]+)\Z/$1 ($3)\n\t$2/' ./cd_data</ins>
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p>You can embed character class shortcuts inside character classes, so for instance, in our example
    <span class="orange">[\d:]</span> is a character class for digits and the colon.</p>
   
   <p>To make sure you understand the effect of <b>-l</b> and the difference between <span class="orange">\z</span> and
    <span class="orange">\Z</span>, try that example with the other possible combinations of the different 
    flags, and also using <span class="orange">\z</span> instead of <span class="orange">\Z</span>.</p>
   
   <p>Go over that last example, carefully inspecting each part of the regex and substitution, until you are 
    sure you understand how it works.</p>
   
   <p><div class="c"><table class="noteBox fBox pBox "><tr><td class="noteTitle">Note</td><td class="note">If you are uncertain about the effects of the <b>-i</b> operation, you can test it without having to
    rename the backup file after each attempt. Just leave out the <b>-i</b> flag

   <p>I'll bet you are going to see <i>lots</i> of ways you can use substitution and the <b>-i</b> flag in 
    your everyday work and leisure coding from now on!</p>
