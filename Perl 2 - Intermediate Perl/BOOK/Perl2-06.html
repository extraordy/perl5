  <p>"You can't quantify love." -Emily Giffin</p>
   
  <p>If you've ever been frustrated when you run into the gap between what you've wanted to do with regular expressions and 
   what you can do, that's about to change. This lesson introduces the concept of the regex 
   <i>quantifier</i>, which lets you vary the <i>number</i> of things you are able to match.</p>
   
  <p>So far, everything you've seen that can go into a regex, matches one, and only one, character, or the 
   regex fails to match. When the regex does match, you've had ordinary characters like <span class="orange">'Q'</span> and 
   <span class="orange">'!'</span> that match literally, or you have a character class in square 
   brackets, or a shortcut for a character class.</p>
   
  <p>The <i>quantifier</i> is not a new kind of thing to match. (By the way, the technical term for a 
   unit of matching in a regex is not "thing" but an "atom"; I'll use that term from now on because I think you're 
   ready for advanced terminology now.) A quantifier modifies an atom in a regex by saying that you want to match 
   some number of that atom (occurring consecutively at that point in the input) that is not necessarily
   exactly one.</p>
   
  <p>We learned earlier that regular expressions were invented by mathematicians, so it comes as no surprise now
   to learn that the majority of quantifiers are expressed with single (and cryptic) characters. Before 
   I introduce them, let's take a quick look at some examples of where and why you might want to use 
   quantifiers.</p>
   
  <ul><li><b>Optional presence:</b> You are matching a word that may or may not be present in the plural form 
    by the addition of the letter <span class="orange">'s'</span> (example inputs: <span class="orange">'apple'</span> and 
    <span class="orange">'apples'</span>). <b>Or</b>: You are matching a number that may or may not have a decimal point in 
    the middle (examples: <span class="orange">3.14159</span> and <span class="orange">42</span>).</li><li><b>Zero or more:</b> You are matching a number again, and after the decimal point there may be any 
    number of digits, including zero (examples: <span class="orange">17.</span> and <span class="orange">101.7</span>). <b>Or</b>: You 
    are picking apart text containing mathematical expressions and there may or may not be white space 
    characters surrounding binary operators like <span class="blue">=</span> and <span class="blue">+</span>; in fact, it could be 
    any amount of white space, or none at all (examples: <span class="orange">E = m * c**2</span> and 
    <span class="orange">s=d*t**2/2</span>).</li><li><b>One or more:</b> You are matching a number again. This one has at least one digit before 
    the decimal point, possibly more (for example, <span class="orange">2.71828</span> and <span class="orange">98.4</span>). <b>Or</b>: 
    You are matching a word; it contains one or more letters, but you see no need to go to the Guinness 
    Book of Records to find out the length of the longest word in existence just so you can limit the range 
    of the match; you know that the input is well-behaved enough that "infinite" will do as a maximum length 
    specification.</li><li><b>Exact number:</b> You're matching an airline ticket locator code like we did in the last lesson.
    Rather than repeat the specification for each character 6 times, you want to say, "Match this (character 
    specification) 6 times."  <b>Or</b>: You have a report containing FedEx tracking numbers that are exactly 22 
    digits long.</li><li><b>Length range:</b> You're creating a crossword puzzle and you want to select words from the 
    dictionary that are between 3 and 10 letters long. <b>Or</b>: You are matching an IP address (version 4) and 
    each octet is a decimal number one to three digits long (examples: <span class="orange">63.171.219.89</span> and 
    <span class="orange">208.201.239.101</span>).</li></ul>
   
  <p>And now...here are the quantifiers themselves. They are placed <i>after</i> the atom that they 
   quantify in a regex. So instead of a regex reading like the (more intuitive) "<i>this many</i> of 
   <i>this</i>," it calls for, "<i>this thing</i>, <i>this many</i> times." </p>
   
 <div class="c"> <table class="tbl" border=""><tr><th>Quantifier</th><th>Interpretation</th><th>Example</th><th>Meaning</th></tr><tr><td><span class="orange">?</span></td><td>Optional (zero or one)</td><td><span class="orange">/apples? and bananas?/</span></td><td>Match <span class="orange">'apple and banana'</span> or <span class="orange">'apples and banana'</span>or

  <p>The lines that contain either correct and incorrect IP addresses each match the pattern for a 
   floating point number, because they contain digits followed by a period, followed by digits. But 
   <span class="orange">12.123.1234.12</span> does <i>not</i> match the pattern for an IP address, because there are 
   four digits in the third octet, while the pattern says there can be at most 3. Because the pattern must 
   still match something more (a period) after that third octet, the match fails. </p>
   
  <p>The quantifiers are what we call <i>greedy</i>: they will match as much as they can. As long as they 
   can keep finding something in the input to match, they will keep matching. People often think 
   that means the quantifiers find the longest possible match in the input. That is <i>not</i> true. As long as a
   successful match can be found, the regex will match the <i>first</i> one that it finds, scanning from 
   left to right. For instance, the regex:</p>
   
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: Regex</div><div class="observe"><pre><span class="orange">/[A-Z]+\d*/</span>
</pre></div></div>
   
  <p>...when applied to the input:</p>
   
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: Input</div><div class="observe"><pre><span class="orange">"I am THX1138"</span>
</pre></div></div>
   
  <p>...will match <span class="orange">'I'</span>, <i>not</i> <span class="orange">'THX1138'</span>. It needs at least one 
   upper-case letter; <span class="orange">'I'</span> qualifies, so it matches; there are no more letters, so next it 
   needs zero or more digits; there are no digits, but that's okay, because zero is a valid number to match, 
   and so it stops.</p>
   
  <p>This is an important point and worth exploring in depth. Suppose the regex had been:</p>
   
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: Regex</div><div class="observe"><pre><span class="orange">/\w+\d+/</span>
</pre></div></div>
   
  <p>...and the input had been:</p>
   
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: Input</div><div class="observe"><pre><span class="orange">"Robert Duvall is THX1138"</span>
</pre></div></div>
   
  <p>In this case, the regex engine starts matching with the <span class="orange">'R'</span>, and keep matching letters greedily,
   until it comes to the first space, at which point it can no longer match <span class="orange">\w+</span>, so it 
   looks to see whether it can match the <i>next</i> thing, which is <span class="orange">\d+</span>. That requires 
   <i>at least</i> one digit, and there isn't one. The regex engine then <i>backtracks,</i> unwinding each 
   character it matched, looking for a digit, but does not find one. It backtracks all the way to the 
   beginning without success, and then it moves the pointer forward by one character and starts again. 
   (This may sound inefficient, but the regex engine is full of optimizations to make this process faster.)</p>
   
  <p>The regex engine continues in that way (reading <span class="orange">'Duvall'</span> and <span class="orange">'is'</span> as 
   matches against <span class="orange">\w+</span> but not finding a match for <span class="orange">\d+</span>) until it matches 
   <span class="orange">\w+</span> with <span class="orange">'THX1138'</span>. Why does that whole string match 
   <span class="orange">\w+</span>? Because <span class="orange">\w</span> <i>includes</i> digits in its specification! At this 
   point, the regex engine sees that it has reached the end of the string, so it starts backtracking. It 
   unwinds by one character—<span class="orange">'8'</span>—and tries again to see if it has a match for 
   <span class="orange">\d+</span>. It <i>does</i>. Then it tries matching more digits greedily, but it has 
   reached the end of the input. It looks at the regex and finds that there is nothing more to be
   matched. It has found a match—the <span class="orange">\w+</span> matched <span class="orange">'THX113'</span>, and the 
   <span class="orange">\d+</span> matched <span class="orange">'8'</span>—so it returns success.</p>
  
  <p>Okay, so you can tell <i>whether</i> an input string is matched by a 
   regex, but not exactly <i>what</i> matched that regex. And just knowing that there's (for example) a part number or a zip code 
   in a string may not be good enough; you may want to know the specific part number, without resorting to using 
   <span class="darkgreen">index()</span> and <span class="darkgreen">substr()</span>. If the regex engine could find the 
   match for you, shouldn't it be able to tell you which part matched? Yes, it should, and it will. That's coming in the 
   next lesson!</p>
   
 </div>
 <a name="h_02"></a><div class="heading">Regex Crafting</div><div class="headingText">
   
  <p>Picking the right regex for a particular problem is something of an art. Rarely is it necessary to 
   craft a regex that matches just what you need and nothing else. For instance, the pattern we used above for an 
   IP address can still match an invalid address like <span class="orange">1.2.999.3</span> (it matches because each octet has 1 to 3 digits; 
   it is invalid because the biggest octet should be 254), but usually 
   when you are looking for an IP address the input will be sufficiently constrained. 
   Under some circumstances, any input containing just 
   digits will be an IP address because all other possibilities <i>in the problem domain you are 
    solving</i> are exhausted. The 
   complete regex that matches <i>only</i> valid IPV4 addresses is much more complicated. However, there are 
   modules that you can use, notably <b>Regexp::Common::net</b>, that encapsulate that complexity for you. 
   Once you learn how to download and use modules, you can choose whether you want to adopt that approach 
   for regexes for common patterns. There's nothing to be gained from using a regex that's longer than necessary, and you will lose 
   readability, so think carefully before making a complex regex just for the sake of it.</p>
    
  <p>Take a look at the last regex in <span class="darkred">reg_quantifiers.pl</span>:</p>
    
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: Regex</div><div class="observe"><pre>
/\d+\s+apples?.*\d+\s+bananas?/
</pre></div></div>
    
  <p>That's a common idiom: match something you want, followed by some arbitrary number of 
   characters that you don't care about, followed by something else that you want. You'll end up using this pattern a 
   lot. Now, I know that <span class="orange">.</span> matches any character <i>except</i> <span class="orange">\n</span>, and you 
   might wonder why it doesn't just match any character. Most of the time you'll be 
   matching against a single line that you've read in and <span class="darkgreen">chomp</span>ed, so it won't mater. 
   Also, when matching against multiline text, it's far more common to want to constrain your
   matches to within a single line than not, so this implementation of <span class="orange">.</span> is intentional.</p>
    
  <p>Let's do another example!  Create <span class="darkred">reg_email.pl</span>:</p>
    
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE: reg_email.pl</div><div class="listing"><pre><ins>#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

while ( defined( my $line = &lt;DATA&gt; ) )
{
  chomp $line;
  print "'$line' contains an email address\n"
    if $line =~ s/\w+\@\w+\.\w\w\w/*****/;   # Won't match all possible email addresses!

   The email address <span class="orange">'*@example.com'</span> is perfectly legal; some people 
   have addresses like that. Still, they are rejected by most of the email validation code on the web. Before 
   you decide on a regex for matching email addresses, you need to think about what you're trying to 
   accomplish and what the tradeoffs are for your choices. The regular expression that <i>technically</i> matches the legal 
   specification for an email address is a <i>page</i> long, and it probably isn't what you really want 
   anyway. To get the current best advice on solving this problem, run <b>perldoc perlfaq9</b> and see the 
   section titled "How do I check a valid mail address?"</p>
    
  <p><div class="c"><table class="noteBox fBox pBox "><tr><td class="noteTitle">Note</td><td class="note">The <span class="orange">@</span> in the regex does not <i>need</i> to be escaped, because it is followed 
   by a backslash. But it's worth doing consistently anyway, because if it were followed by, for example, a letter, 
   let's say <span class="orange">'q'</span>, Perl would think that we were trying to interpolate an array named 
   <span class="red">@q</span>, and we'd get into trouble.</td></tr></table></div></p>
    
 </div>
 <a name="h_03"></a><div class="heading">Food for Thought</div><div class="headingText">
  
  <p>Using regular expressions requires understanding lots of subtle details—you're learning a whole new language after all! 
   For instance, matching something 
   optional—for example, the <span class="orange">s?</span> in <span class="orange">/apples?/</span>—only makes 
   sense if you're matching something else after that. Otherwise, it's pointless, because you've already found a match with everything that 
   came before the optional part; you get exactly the same outcome regardless of whether the optional part is present, 
   because it can always match nothing. </p>
   
  <p>Creating regexes that can match nothing is a common mistake. 
   Let's say a programmer (not you, of course) tries to write a regex that will match any kind of number at 
   all, and thinks to himself, "it can have digits before and after a decimal point, like 
   <span class="orange">12.34</span>, so I'll have a regex of <span class="orange">/\d+\.\d+/</span>. But wait, the digits before 
   the decimal point are optional: I could have a number like <span class="orange">.12</span>, so my regex is really 
   <span class="orange">/\d*\.\d+/</span>. No, wait, the digits after the decimal point are optional too, because I 
   could have a number like <span class="orange">12.</span>, so my regex is really <span class="orange">/\d*\.\d*/</span>. But 
   wait, I could have a number like <span class="orange">1234</span> so the decimal point is optional there too, and that 
   means my regex is really <span class="orange">/\d*\.?\d*/</span>."</p>
  
  <p>There's the problem with that logic, and it's worth seeing it in action. 
   Create <span class="darkred">reg_number.pl</span> as shown:</p>

  <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it.  What is the output? Why do you think 
   that happened?</p>
   
  <p>The problem is that this regex can match <i>nothing:</i> no digits, followed by no period, followed by 
   no digits. And every possible input can always satisfy that immediately; each one has 'nothing' before 
   the first character ever appears. Add a blank line in the inputs:</p>

  <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it.</p>
  
  <p>Even the blank line matches!  
   Because we have <span class="darkgreen">chomp</span>ed off the newline character, we really <i>are</i> matching 
   against the empty string (zero length), and Perl can always find the empty string at the beginning of 
    every input.</p>
   
  <p>The easiest way to fix this particular case is with multiple regexes. There are

  <p>Why did that happen? Think it over.</p>
     
  <p>The quantifier is both concise and powerful, and provides the foundation for regular expressions. 
   If your understanding of any part of this lesson is still fuzzy, go back and study it some more. Play with the examples, 
   modify them, and ask your instructor for clarification where necessary.</p>
   
  <p>In the next lesson, we'll build on what you've learned so far to quantify a literal character or 
   something matching a single character, and eventually quantify something even longer!</p>
