 <a href="Perl2-11.html" name="w_flag"></a>
 <a name="h_01"></a><div class="heading">The -w Flag</div><div class="headingText">
   
   <p>If you get ambitious with the <b>-e</b> flag, you'll appreciate the benefits of turning on warnings. 
    Instead of having to type <span class="darkred">use warnings</span> at the beginning of the <b>-e</b> argument, 
    you can include <b>-w</b> in the list of perl flags.</p>   
   
   <p>A handy use of <b>-e</b> is to test out some feature of Perl quickly, before using it in a program 
    you're developing. Suppose that you want to perform host name to IP address resolution and you 
    think you heard somewhere 
    that Perl has the <span class="darkgreen">gethostbyname</span> function. You confirm this with <b>perldoc -f 
      gethostbyname</b>, and see the basic syntax for using it. But you want to be sure you're using it properly before you 
     put it in your program, and the documentation you see describes over a dozen other
     functions at the same time. A quick and dirty one-liner is a perfect tool to make sure you're using the function the right way. 
    Since whatever you learn is going to be used in a real program, you may want to make sure that warnings are 
    enabled in your one-liner as well. No problem! Even a typo that results in a nonexistent host 
    is easier to diagnose with <b>-w</b>. Type the code below in the Unix window as shown:</p>
  
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE TERMINAL SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~$ <ins>perl -MSocket -le 'print inet_ntoa scalar gethostbyname "www.perl.org"'</ins>
cold:~$ <ins>perl -MSocket -le 'print inet_ntoa scalar gethostbyname "www.perl.orc"'</ins>
Bad arg length for Socket::inet_ntoa, length is 0, should be 4 at -e line 1.
cold:~$ 
</pre></div></div>
  
   <p>Now try it with <b>-w</b>. Type the code below in the Unix window as shown:</p>
  
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE TERMINAL SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~$ perl -MSocket -<ins>w</ins>le 'print inet_ntoa scalar gethostbyname "www.perl.org"'
cold:~$ perl -MSocket -<ins>w</ins>le 'print inet_ntoa scalar gethostbyname "www.perl.orc"'
Use of uninitialized value in subroutine entry at -e line 1.
Bad arg length for Socket::inet_ntoa, length is 0, should be 4 at -e line 1.
cold:~$ 
</pre></div></div>
  
  <p>This tells us that we should check the return from <span class="darkgreen">gethostbyname</span> before deciding 
   whether to pass it to <span class="darkgreen">inet_ntoa</span>. This is in agreement with the documentation. So we 
   come up with this version:</p>
  
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE TERMINAL SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~$ <ins>perl -MSocket -wle '$packed_addr = gethostbyname "www.perl.org"; defined $packed_addr and print inet_ntoa $packed_addr'</ins>
</pre></div></div>
  
  <p>It's almost ready to paste into a program. We'd just need to add in <span class="purple">my</span> to get it 
   to work with <span class="darkred">use strict</span>. Which brings us to our next topic...</p>
  
   </div>
 <a href="Perl2-11.html" name="mstrict_flag"></a>
 <a name="h_02"></a><div class="heading">The -Mstrict Flag</div><div class="headingText">
   
   <p>So you've seen that <b>-w</b> invokes <span class="darkred">use warnings</span> in a one-liner;
    now what about <span class="darkred">use strict</span>? There isn't a single letter flag that gives you the same 
    capability. But you can use the <b>-M</b> flag, which is equivalent to <span class="darkred">use</span>, and 
    pass <b>strict</b> as an argument, giving you this:</p>

<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: -Mstrict</div><div class="observe"><pre>
<b>perl -Mstrict ...</b>
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p>Now the code passed to <b>-e</b> must pass strictness checks as well.</p>
   
   <p>Since <b>-M</b> is a flag that means <span class="darkred">use</span>, <b>-Mwarnings</b> should be the 
     equivalent of <span class="darkred">use warnings</span>. The 
    <b>-w</b> flag dates back to the earliest version of Perl, preceding the introduction of the 
    <span class="darkred">use</span> statement. Its effect is technically slightly different from that produced by 
    <span class="darkred">use warnings</span>, but the difference is not relevant until you get much further along 
    with Perl programming. For now, just know that in this course you're learning the best practices.</p>

   <p>I want you to be <i>dissatisfied</i> any time you have code that doesn't 
    look beautiful or map cleanly to the solution you've devised for a problem. When we translate the solution 
    to a problem from its inception in our minds, into a computer language, some of its original elegance is always lost. 
    Ideally, we'll use a language and write our programs such that degradation is minimized. One way we'll know that we
    have not translated our vision cleanly is by the presence of repetitive code.</p>
   
   <p>If we apply that philosophical tangent to the program we're working on now, it would go something like this: The
    <span class="purple">if...else</span> statement in our program is unsatisfying for some reason. The repetition of the 
    <span class="darkgreen">print</span> statement may be a clue. The loop contents are: "Print 
    <span class="red">$text</span>, followed by "matches" or "doesn't match" depending on whether the regex matched, 
    followed by the closing text."  When we wrote our program, the only syntax we had available to us was the 
    <span class="purple">if...else</span> statement, so we had to compromise.</p>
   
   <p>But Perl incorporates an operator that can help improve our existing code. It has various names: 
    trinary operator, ternary operator, hook operator, tertiary operator. That's a lot of 
    verbiage for one operator; here's what it looks like:</p>
   
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: Trinary Operator</div><div class="observe"><pre>
<i>condition</i> ? <i>true_result</i> : <i>false_result</i>
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p>The value of this expression is <i>true_result</i> if <i>condition</i> is true, and <i>false_result</i> 
    if <i>condition</i> is false.  It works in scalar context and also list context:</p>
   
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: Trinary Operator Examples</div><div class="observe"><pre>
$sign = $number &lt; 0 ? '-' : '+';

<span class="red">@tokens</span> = /(\w+)\s+(\w+)/ ? ($1, $2) : <span class="red">@DEFAULT_TOKENS</span>;
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p>In the second line, the regex is matching against <span class="red">$_</span>; if it succeeds, the two capturing 
    groups get put into <span class="red">@tokens</span>, otherwise <span class="red">@tokens</span> is assigned from 
    <span class="red">@DEFAULT_TOKENS</span>.</p>
   
   <p>Those examples both involve assignments, but the trinary operator shows up just as often as part 
    of a larger expression. Modify <span class="darkred">reg_literal2.pl</span> as shown:</p>
   
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO EDIT: reg_literal2.pl</div><div class="listing"><pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

foreach my $text ( qw(Matt bats the ball at Atticus) )
{
  <del>print qq{"$text" }, 
  $text =~ /at/ )
  {
    print "matches";
  }
  else
  {
    print "does not match";
  }
  print " /at/\n";</del><ins>
  print qq{"$text" }, $text =~ /at/ ? "matches" : "does not match", " /at/\n";</ins>
}  
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it. Now <i>that</i> is some serious code 
    streamlining!</p>
   
   <p>The trinary operator is often helpful in one-liners. Let's modify one from earlier in this lesson. 
     Type the code below in the Unix window as shown:</p>
   
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE TERMINAL SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~/perl2$ <ins>perl -MSocket -wle '$packed_addr = gethostbyname shift; print defined $packed_addr ? inet_ntoa $packed_addr : "unknown host"' www.perl.orc</ins>
unknown host
code:~/perl2$
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p>Now fix the typo in the host name. You can just use the up arrow key to repeat the code and then edit it as shown:</p>
   
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE TERMINAL SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~/perl2$ perl -MSocket -wle '$packed_addr = gethostbyname shift; print defined $packed_addr ? inet_ntoa $packed_addr : "unknown host"' www.perl.or<del>c</del><ins>g</ins>
207.171.7.63
cold:~/perl2$ 
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p>Now it prints an IP address. This example also illustrates how you can shift a parameter to the input list 
    in <span class="red">@ARGV</span> in a one-liner; the command line arguments to the <b>-e</b> code come after the 
    <b>-e</b> code, and we get at them by referencing <span class="red">@ARGV</span> or by calling 
    <span class="darkgreen">shift</span> outside of a subroutine. </p>
   
  <a name="s_01"></a><div id="s_01"><div class="subheading">Nesting the Trinary Operator</div><div class="subheadingText">
   
   <p>The precedence of the trinary operator is such that it can be nested without parentheses to provide 
    the functional equivalent of an <span class="purple">if...else</span> block, with an arbitrary number of
    <span class="purple">elsif</span> clauses. Format this carefully to make sure it's readable. Let's revisit a 
    familiar example from the first O'Reilly School Perl course. Create <span class="darkred">bmi2.pl</span> as 
    shown:</p>
   
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE: bmi2.pl</div><div class="listing"><pre><ins>#!/usr/bin/perl

use warnings;

die "Usage: $0 height (inches) weight (pounds)\n" unless @ARGV == 2;

my ($height, $weight) = @ARGV;
my $bmi = $weight * 703 / $height ** 2;

print $bmi &lt; 18.5 ? "Underweight"
    : $bmi &lt; 24.9 ? "Normal"
    : $bmi &lt; 29.9 ? "Overweight"
    :               "Obese",
    "\n";</ins>
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p>The formatting makes all the difference in readability here. If that clause were written in 
    a single line, you'd have a much harder time understanding or verifying its operation:</p>
   
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: Bad formatting</div><div class="observe"><pre>
print $bmi &lt; 18.5 ? "Underweight" : $bmi &lt; 24.9 ? "Normal" : $bmi &lt; 29.9 ? "Overweight" : "Obese", "\n";

  <a name="s_02"></a><div id="s_02"><div class="subheading">The Trinary Operator as Lvalue</div><div class="subheadingText">
   
   <p>This modest little operator, unlike its counterpart in some other languages, can even be used as an

   <p>The trinary operator may remind you of the <span class="purple">if...(then)...else</span> block. Perl won't stop
    you from using it instead of such a block, but it is really bad style to use the trinary operator in void 
    context, that is, where you are not using its result, but for control flow. That 
    could confuse your readers.</p>

  <p>When I introduced it, I only showed its effect in <i>list</i> context. But in <i>scalar</i> context, the 
   range operator has positively magical behavior. It acquires a memory of its <i>state</i>; in this case, it 
   has two states and is therefore a <i>bistable flip-flop</i>. Specifically, every time it is evaluated (and 
   by "it" I mean "this instance in the code of the scalar range operator, not one somewhere else, even if it 
   has the same arguments; this operator is only meaningful inside a loop) in the initial 
   state, Perl evaluates just the expression on the left side, until that expression returns true; after that, 
   the range operator evaluates only its right hand side 
   and returns true until the right hand side becomes true, after which it returns false again.</p>
   
  <p>That's a lot to take in—let's try an example. Create

Subject: Perl 2, Lesson 11

Hi Scott.  I just uploaded Lesson 11 of the
Intermediate Perl series.  The students are
really going to love the new one-liner capabilities!
.
Junk that's not part of the message...</ins>
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it.  The specification for email messages is 
   that the body text comes after the first blank line; here we'll also pretend that a line containing just 
   a period ends the email message and anything following that is not part of the message.</p>
   
  <p>You can see the effect of the flip-flop here. The expressions left and right of the operator are both regular
   expressions operating by default on <span class="red">$_</span>. Until the expression on the left becomes true, the operator will 
   return false; the left-side regex (<span class="orange">/\A\Z/</span>) is true when we reach a line that contains 
   nothing between the beginning of the string and the end of the string, which may be preceded by a newline 
   character (that's our blank line).</p>
   
  <p>Thereafter, the scalar range operator will return true until its right side becomes true; the 
   right-side regex (<span class="orange">/\A\.\Z/</span>) is true when we reach a line that consists of precisely a 
   period, optionally followed by a newline.</p>
   
  <p>You can have any expression you want on either side. The scalar range operator still has one more trick. If 
   either the left or the right side is an integer, it will be compared to the line number of the current 
   input stream. Create <span class="darkred">numbering.pl</span> as shown:</p>
   
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE: numbering.pl</div><div class="listing"><pre><ins>#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

while ( &lt;DATA&gt; )
{
  print if ( 3 .. 5 ) || ( 10 .. 11 );
}

Dear Sir,

I received your request for a reference for Mr. Ronald Smith,
who is interviewing with your company and hoping to obtain
employment.  I am quite happy to report that
he performed his duties with exemplary conduct during his
entire tenure at our firm and we were eminently satisfied
with his product.
Whenever we observed him creating computer programs,
it was a pleasure to see him go; I cannot find the
words to describe how disgusted we were by his output
of a letter of resignation.</ins>
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it. Oh my—we <i>do</i> need to check our 
     output! We've actually got two scalar range operators at work there, which resulted in  
   printing only lines 3 through 5 and 10 through 11 of the DATA stream.</p>
   <p>You're doing great so far, and adding lots of handy new tools to your toolbox! Keep it up!</p>
  
 </div>

    the assignments.</p>
