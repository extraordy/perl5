  When you complete this lesson, you will be able to:
  
  <ul><li>use regex anchors to mark the boundary between a string of digits and something that isn't a 
    string of digits.</li><li>use regex captures.</li></ul>
 </div><hr>
 
  <p>The key concepts we need to learn here are <i>anchors</i> (how to match a <i>place</i> rather 
   than a <i>thing</i>), and <i>captures</i> (how to get at what part of a regex matched).</p>
  
  <a name="h_01"></a><div class="heading">Anchors</div><div class="headingText">
   
   <p>Until now, we've had difficulty telling Perl where to stop matching. 
    For instance, looking for a US zip code with the regex <span class="orange">/\d{5}</span> worked fine for input 
    like <span class="orange">"Sebastopol, CA 94572"</span>, but it also matched when the input was 
    <span class="orange">"Pi is about 3.14159265"</span>. That may not matter—it could be that 
    for the problem you're solving, all inputs that contain five consecutive digits will 
    always contain only zip codes, so your regex is adequate. But what if that's not the case? Suppose you want to 
    "match five consecutive digits, but no more"?</p>
   
   <p>We can solve this problem already—kind of. Consider the regex <span class="orange">/\D\d{5}\D/</span>. "Match
    a non-digit, followed by 5 digits, followed by a non-digit." That'll successfully discriminate against 
    our Pi example above, because every group of five digits is either preceded or succeeded by a digit. But 
    what about certain inputs that <i>should</i> match, like <span class="orange">"Sebastopol, CA 94572"</span>? That 
    no longer matches, because the five digits are not followed by a non-digit—they're not followed by 
    anything at all!</p>
   
   <p>Instead, we want to say, "Match five digits that are not preceded by a digit and not followed by a 
    digit." Do you see the difference between that and the regex we had before? We need to allow for the 
    possibility that the string will start with the five digits or end with the five digits, or maybe even be 
    composed exactly of five digits.</p>
   
   <p>In short, we need to match a <i>place</i>, rather than a character, on each end of our five digits; we 
    want to indicate that a specific place marks the boundary between a string of digits and something that isn't a 
    string of digits. Perl lets us do that in the form of an <i>anchor</i> called the 
    <i>word boundary</i>, expressed with the sequence <span class="orange">\b</span>. Let's try an example to see this in 
    action. Create <span class="darkred">reg_boundary.pl</span> as shown:</p>

<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE: reg_boundary.pl</div><div class="listing"><pre><ins>#!/usr/bin/perl

{
  chomp $line;
  printf "%40s", $line;
  foreach my $regex ( @regexes )
  {
    if ( $line =~ /$regex/ )
    {
      printf "%10s", "   X   ";
    }
    else
    {
      printf "%10s", "";
    }
  }
  print "\n";
}

   <p>The last regex is the only one to correctly match what we want and nothing more, in all
    cases. The <span class="orange">\b</span> <i>word boundary</i> anchor matches a <i>place</i> (something that 
    has no width, contains no characters) that can be described like this: "On one side is a word 
    character, and on the other side is not a word character." Keep in mind that "not a word character" is 
    <i>not</i> the same as "a character that isn't a word character." Also, remember that a word character is 
    the character class of letters, digits, and the underscore character. Look over the results in the table, 
    make sure you understand them, and play with changing the program until you're comfortable with it.</p>
   
   <p>There isn't a special anchor that only matches the boundary between digits and not-digits, so we used 
    the closest thing, which worked for all our above examples. Just to make sure you understand its 
    limitations as well, make this change to the code:</p>

   <p><span class="orange">/\b\d{5}\b/</span> 
    does <i>not</i> match the last input. Because underscore is a word character, we do 
    not have a word boundary on either side of the five digits; <span class="orange">_9</span> is a word
    character (<span class="orange">_</span>) followed by another word character (<span class="orange">9</span>), and 
    <span class="orange">2_</span> is a word character (<span class="orange">2</span>) followed by another word
    character (<span class="orange">_</span>). Either one of those is sufficient for the regex to fail to match.</p>
   
   <p>All of these failing examples may make you wonder whether 
    you could ever write a regex that will match right. Don't worry. Our exploration of 
    regexes and consequences is meant to get you in the habit of 
    thinking about them correctly, that way, when you have a real problem to solve, you'll be able to 
    craft an appropriate regex. Most real problems are not as vexing as the examples we've come up with for you to wrestle with in these 
    lessons—after all, how often do you encounter zip codes with underscores on each end?</p>
   
   <p>Also, you've seen the substitution operator in our examples of regular expressions so far, but it isn't always going to be there.
    It's actually more common to match than to 
    substitute; we've used substitutions primarily as a teaching aid, but that's going to change. 
    Substituting wouldn't be as instructive where anchors are involved because they match 
    <i>places</i>, not <i>characters</i>. </p>
   
   <p>Alright then. Here are two anchors that are likely to be even more useful to you than <span class="orange">\b</span>.</p>
   
   <ul><li>Match beginning of string: <span class="orange">\A</span>. This sequence matches the place that is the 
     beginning of the string. Whatever comes next in the regex will only match successfully if it is at 
     the beginning of the string. <span class="orange">\A</span> should always be at the beginning of a regex (or at 
     the beginning of an alternation group, which we'll get into shortly) to be meaningful.</li><li>Match ending of string: <span class="orange">\z</span>. Yes, that's a <i>little</i> z. This sequence matches 
     the place that is the ending of the string. Whatever comes before it in the regex will only match
     successfully if it is at the ending of the string. <span class="orange">\z</span> should always be at 
     the end of a regex (or at the end of an alternation group) to be meaningful.</li></ul>
   
   <p>Let's see these in action! Create <span class="darkred">reg_edges.pl</span>:</p>
   
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE: reg_edges.pl</div><div class="listing"><pre><ins>#!/usr/bin/perl

   <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it. You should see something like this:</p>

   <p>The line that starts and ends with a vowel does <i>not</i> match <span class="orange">/\A[aeiou]+\z/</span> 
    because that regex reads, "Match start of string, one or more vowels, end of string", and after matching 
    the start of the string and the first vowel, what follows is neither a vowel nor the end of the string. 
    That regex will only match strings that consist only of vowels (the <span class="orange">+</span> 
    quantifier means that there must be at least one vowel, so an empty string will not count).</p>
   
   <p>We're using the <span class="orange">/i</span> modifier so that the vowel character class matches the 
    capital <span class="orange">'A'</span>. </p>
   
   <p>Remember that scalars interpolate inside regexes, so if <span class="red">$regex</span> is 
    <span class="orange">'\A[aeiou]'</span>, then <span class="orange">/$regex/</span> is the same as typing 
    <span class="orange">/\A[aeiou]/</span>.  It's pretty uncommon to interpolate scalars inside of regular 
    expressions; I'm doing it here to produce those nice tables. But eventually, when you work your way up to building 
    complex regular expressions from smaller pieces, you may choose to put those pieces in scalars for 
    much the same reason you would use Perl code inside a named subroutine.</p>

   <p>
    We've devoted lots of time and energy learning how to determine whether an input matches a regular expression, but we 
    still haven't learned how to identify the part of the input that's been matched. We'll definitely want to be 
    able to do that. And we can, using one of the most useful features of regular expressions: <b>captures</b>.
    Here's how: </p>
   
   <p><div class="c"><table class="noteBox fBox pBox "><tr><td class="noteTitle">Note</td><td class="note">Place parentheses around the part of the regex that has the match you want to identify. If the match

   <p>You may remember that the list of "special" characters in a regex includes <span class="orange">(</span> and

   <p>Now you can see not only <i>when</i> 
    the regex matched, but <i>what</i> it matched! For the sake of clarity, the 
    <span class="orange">\b</span> anchors were placed outside of the capturing parentheses, but since they match a place (which has 
    zero width), it would have made no difference if we had put them inside. Usually you will only have capturing 
    parentheses around part of a regex, while the rest of the regex sets up the context for that part.</p>
   
   <p><i>Capturing is a tremendously useful feature of regular expressions.</i> It doesn't change 
    <i>what</i> you match, it makes available the parts of the input that <i>did</i> match.</p>
   
   <p>You may be wondering what happens if you have more than one set of parentheses, or whether there's 
    a <span class="red">$2</span> variable. Good! I'm glad you're curious. In fact, the capturing feature is much more general than 
    <span class="red">$1</span>: You can have multiple sets of capturing parentheses, and they will capture to variables 
    named <span class="red">$2</span>, <span class="red">$3</span>, and so on, for as many capturing parentheses as you have.</p>
   
   <p>You can even <i>nest</i> the parentheses so that one match is a subset of another. (It's not too common 
    in practice, but I know you're wondering about it!) If you do that, you'll want to be able to 
    determine which parentheses capture to <span class="red">$1</span> and which capture to <span class="red">$2</span>. 
    Here's the way to remember: The first (leftmost) left parenthesis starts a group that captures to 
    <span class="red">$1</span>. The second left parenthesis captures a group that captures to <span class="red">$2</span>, and so on.</p>
   
   <p>So, let's do another example that shows us the awesome power of multiple capturing parentheses! Create 
    <span class="darkred">reg_capture2.pl</span> as shown:</p>

   <p>If we assume that in any

    all of the characters in the line for that component, but when it reaches the end of the string and then
    sees that the regex requires the next character to be a comma, it backtracks until it has unswallowed 
    the comma. A benefit of using <span class="orange"><b>.*</b></span> is that we can match city names containing any characters (except
