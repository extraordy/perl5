      <h2>Substitution and More One-Liners - Quiz 1</h2> 
      
      
      
      
      <p>How can you get <b>-i</b> to prepend a prefix instead of append a suffix? (Hint: <b>perldoc perlrun</b>)</p>
      
        
      
      
      <p>Put an asterisk (*) in the argument to -i and each applicable filename will be substituted for it, so you can put a prefix
         in front of the asterisk. If the student gives an example, make sure that the asterisk is quoted or escaped so that it is
         not interpreted by the shell for globbing.
      </p>
      
      
      <p><b>Grading Criteria:</b> Student should demonstrate knowledge of using the -i flag for Perl to make altered copies of a given file.</p>
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>What does Perl do if <b>-n</b> or <b>-p</b> is specified and one or more files on the command line does not exist or cannot be read?</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>Prints a warning and carries on.</p>
      
      
      <p><b>Grading Criteria:</b> Student should demonstrate knowledge of how -n and -p relate to how Perl reads files via @ARGV.</p>
