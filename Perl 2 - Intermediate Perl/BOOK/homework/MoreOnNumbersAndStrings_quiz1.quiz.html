      <h2>More on Numbers and Strings; More on Regular Expressions; More on Hashes - Quiz 1</h2> 
      
      
      
      
      <p>Explain the difference between <b>/\b/</b> and <b>"\b".</b></p>
      
        
      
      
      <p><b>/\b/</b> is a regular expression fragment matching a word boundary (it would be useless as it stands without more).</p>
      
      
      <p><b>"\b"</b> is a string containing a backspace control character.</p>
      
      
      <p><b>Grading Criteria:</b> Student should be able to explain the difference between control characters and regular expression fragments.</p>
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>You have the name of the author in <b>$author</b> and the path of this program in <b>$0</b>. What regex will match a 
         string of the form "<i>path</i> was written by <i>author</i>"?
      </p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>/\Q$0\E was written by \Q$author\E/. (The final \E may be omitted.)</p>
      
      
      <p><b>Grading Criteria:</b> Student should demonstrate knowledge of how to properly escape values in a regular expression.</p>
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>How can you get a single quote inside a string in a one-liner? (Hint: <b>perldoc perlop</b>)</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>Use a code for the character; for example "\047" (ASCII code for single quote) or "\x27" (hex).</p>
      
      
      <p><b>Grading Criteria:</b> Student should demonstrate knowledge of how to use shell ASCII and hex character codes.</p>
