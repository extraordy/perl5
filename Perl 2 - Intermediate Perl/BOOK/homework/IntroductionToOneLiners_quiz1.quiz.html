      <h2>Introduction to One-Liners - Quiz 1</h2> 
      
      
      
      
      <p><b>perl -le 'print 42'</b> works; <b>perl -el 'print 42'</b> does not. Why?</p>
      
        
      
      
      <p>Perl sees 'l' as the argument to the -e flag in the second case and executes that code. Due to the absence of the string and
         warnings pragma, no error is emitted, and the code does nothing.
      </p>
      
      
      <p><b>Grading Criteria:</b> Student should demonstrate knowledge of properly using arguments for running perl on the command line.</p>
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p><b>perl -le 'print 'Hello, Sailor!?''</b> does not work. Why? Which of the following Perl operators would let you get 
         the intended effect:
      </p>
      
      
      <ul>
         <li>qq</li>
         <li>qw</li>
         <li>qx</li>
         <li>q</li>
         <li>qr</li>
      </ul>
      
      
      <p>(Hint: <b>perldoc perlop</b>)</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>The single quotes cause the shell to change what it interprets vs. what it passes to Perl. The q{} operator has the same effect
         as single quoting.
      </p>
      
      
      <p><b>Grading Criteria:</b> Student should demonstrate knowledge of when to use the appropriate quote-like operator.</p>
