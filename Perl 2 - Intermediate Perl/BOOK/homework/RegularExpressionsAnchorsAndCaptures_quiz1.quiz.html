      <h2>Regular Expressions: Anchors and Captures - Quiz 1</h2> 
      
      
      
      
      <p>What is the difference between <b>/[A-Z]+\d+/</b> and <b>/[A-Z]+ \d+/</b>?</p>
      
      
      <p>What is the difference between <b>/[A-Z]+ \d+/</b> and <b>/[A-Z]+\s+\d+/</b>?</p>
      
        
      
      
      <p>The space matches literally, so the second regex requires exactly one space whereas the first one requires none. The third
         regex requires at least one whitespace character of any kind, but more are permissible.
      </p>
      
      
      <p><b>Grading Criteria:</b> Student should be able to explain the differences between ' ' and \s in a regular expression.</p>
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <ol>
         <li>Use the <b>\b</b> anchor to construct a regex that matches <b>rap</b>, but not <b>scrape, trap, or rappel</b>.</li>
         <li>What is the operator that will return true only if a regex does <i>not</i> match? (Hint: <b>perldoc perlop</b>, 
            "Binding operators"). 
         </li>
      </ol>
      
      
      
      
      <ol>
         <li>/\brap\b/</li>
         <li>!~</li>
      </ol>
      
      
      <p><b>Grading Criteria:</b> Student should demonstrate their further knowledge of regular expressions based on the topics 
         covered in the lesson.
