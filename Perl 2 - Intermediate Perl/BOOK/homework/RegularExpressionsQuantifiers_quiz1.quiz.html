      <h2>Regular Expressions: Quantifiers - Quiz 1</h2> 
      
      
      
      
      <p>The regular expression <b>/\d*\s*/</b> matches the string "WORD." Why? What part of that string is it matching?</p>
      
        
      
      
      <p>It matches because it is capable of matching nothing, since it is composed entirely of atoms with quantifiers that are allowed
         to match zero items.
      </p>
      
      
      <p><b>Grading Criteria:</b> Student should demonstrate knowledge of some interesting side effects to using * as a quantifier in a regular expression.</p>
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>When the regex <b>/\w+\w*\w+/</b> is applied to the string <b>freedom</b>, what part does the first <b>\w+</b> match, what 
         part does the <b>\w*</b> match, and what part does the second <b>\w+</b> match?
      </p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>\w+ 'freedo'<br>
         \w* ''<br>
         \w+ 'm'
      </p>
      
      
      <p>If the student is confused, explain that this is an example of <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/perlre.html#Backtracking" target="_blank">backtracking</a>.
      </p>
      
      
      <p><b>Grading Criteria:</b> Student should demonstrate knowledge of how a regular expression will often backtrack through a 
         string to try and find a match.
