  When you complete this lesson, you will be able to:
  
  <ul><li>use directory reading functions.</li></ul>
 </div><hr>

 <p>Hello!  In this lesson we'll look at functions that return the names of files on the filesystem. Perl 
  provides two ways of doing that: the <span class="darkgreen">readdir</span> function that's borrowed from the C 
  language binding to the Unix system call of the same name, and the <span class="darkgreen">glob</span> operator 
  that's borrowed from the Unix shell capability.</p>
  
 <a name="h_01"></a><div class="heading">opendir, readdir, closedir</div><div class="headingText">
   
  <p>In the Unix filesystem, a directory is just another file, albeit one that is treated differently and is  
   it is hard for you to read it directly like a file.  The functions <span class="darkgreen">opendir</span>,
   <span class="darkgreen">readdir</span>, and <span class="darkgreen">closedir</span> are used for reading directory files; 
   they have a lot in common with the normal file access functions of <span class="darkgreen">open</span>,
   <span class="darkgreen">readline</span>, and <span class="darkgreen">close</span>. Perl provides the directory functions
   even on non-Unix systems, so you don't need to worry about cross-platform compatibility. Here's how they 
   work:</p>
   
  <ul><li><span class="darkgreen">opendir</span> creates a directory handle, like an input filehandle, 
    except that you can only use it for 
    calling the next two functions. If the directory cannot be read for any reason, 
    <span class="darkgreen">opendir</span> returns false and sets <span class="red">$!</span> (similar to 
    <span class="darkgreen">open</span>).</li><li><span class="darkgreen">readdir</span> takes a directory handle as argument and, in a scalar context, acts as 
    an iterator, returning the next filename from the directory until there are none left, at which point it 
    returns <span class="orange">undef</span> (just like <span class="darkgreen">readline</span>). In a list context, it returns 
    all the remaining filenames in the directory.</li><li><span class="darkgreen">closedir</span> tells Perl that you are done using the directory handle that you pass 
    to this function. If you follow the good practice of creating the directory handle in a scope that ends 
    when you are done with the directory anyway, you can omit this call because Perl will call it for you 
    implicitly when it destroys the storage associated with the directory handle as it goes out of scope.</li></ul>
   
  <p>Let's see these functions in action. Create <span class="darkred">dir_read.pl</span> as shown:</p>
   
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE: dir_read.pl</div><div class="listing"><pre><ins>#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

my $dir = '.';
opendir my $dh, $dir or die "Couldn't open $dir: $!\n";
while ( my $file_name = readdir $dh )
{
  print "$dir: $file_name\n";
}
closedir $dh;

$dir = '/etc';
opendir $dh, $dir or die "Couldn't open $dir: $!\n";
for my $file_name ( readdir $dh )
{
  print "$dir: $file_name\n";
}</ins>
</pre></div></div>
   
  <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it.  Let's take a closer look.</p>
    
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: dir_read.pl</div><div class="observe"><pre>#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

my $dir = <span class="orange">'.'</span>;
opendir <span class="purple">my</span> <span class="red">$dh</span>, $dir or die "Couldn't open $dir: $!\n";
<span class="purple">while</span> ( my $file_name = <span class="darkgreen">readdir</span> $dh )
{
  print "$dir: $file_name\n";
}
closedir <span class="red">$dh</span>;

$dir = <span class="orange">'/etc'</span>;
opendir <span class="red">$dh</span>, $dir or die "Couldn't open $dir: $!\n";
<span class="purple">for</span> my $file_name ( readdir <span class="red">$dh</span> )
{
  print "$dir: $file_name\n";
}
</pre></div></div>
  
  <p>In the <span class="purple">while</span> loop, we call <span class="darkgreen">readdir</span> in scalar context, so it acts 
   as an iterator. We call the <span class="purple">foreach</span> loop in list context, so we get back all the 
   filenames. Get in the habit of processing filenames one at a time (in scalar 
   context) to save time and memory.</p>
   
  <p><span class="orange">'.'</span> is the current directory. <span class="orange">'/etc'</span> is a system directory we know 
   will exist on any Unix or Linux system.</p>
   
  <p>The file names are returned in random order (okay, the order depends on esoteric 
   and idiosyncratic properties of your filesystem but is, for all intents and purposes, random).</p>
   
  <p>Also, consider the scoping of <span class="red">$dh</span>, the directory handle: we declared <span class="red">$dh</span> with <span class="purple">my</span> 
   at the moment of first use, which is in the outermost scope level, so it still exists after the loop 
   and should not be declared again.</p>
   
  <p>Finally, each directory contains files with the names <span class="orange">'.'</span> and 
   <span class="orange">'..'</span>.  They are in fact directories (subdirectories look the same as normal files to 
   <span class="darkgreen">readdir</span>), and are placed in every directory by the operating system for purposes of 
   navigation. <span class="orange">'.'</span> is the current directory itself (this is rarely useful), and 
   <span class="orange">'..'</span> is the parent directory.  Even the top-most directory (<span class="orange">'/'</span> on a 
   Unix or Linux system) still contains <span class="orange">'..'</span>; it just points to itself. Usually, you'll 
   ignore those files. Now exclude <b>.</b> and <b>..</b> by modifying the code as shown:</p>
  
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO EDIT: dir_read.pl</div><div class="listing"><pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

my $dir = '.';
opendir my $dh, $dir or die "Couldn't open $dir: $!\n";
while ( my $file_name = readdir $dh )
{
<ins>  next if $file_name =~ /\A\.\.?\z/;</ins>
  print "$dir: $file_name\n";
}
closedir $dh;

$dir = '/etc';
opendir $dh, $dir or die "Couldn't open $dir: $!\n";
for my $file_name ( readdir $dh )
{
<ins>  next if $file_name =~ /\A\.\.?\z/;</ins>
  print "$dir: $file_name\n";
}</pre></div></div>
   
  <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it, and verify that <span class="orange">'.'</span> and 
   <span class="orange">'..'</span> are no longer in the output.</p>
 
 </div>
 <a name="h_02"></a><div class="heading">glob</div><div class="headingText">
   
  <p>The other directory-reading function is called <span class="darkgreen">glob</span>. It takes as an argument a 
   glob <i>pattern</i>. In list context, it returns a list of all the matching filenames. In scalar 
   context, it acts as an iterator just like <span class="darkgreen">readdir</span>. The big difference between <span class="darkgreen">glob</span> 
   and <span class="darkgreen">readdir</span> is that <span class="darkgreen">glob</span> 
   leaves in the output any directory path, absolute or relative, that you included in the pattern.</p>
  
  <p>So what is the glob pattern? It's <i>like</i> a regular expression but it isn't one. It's the same kind 
   of pattern that you can type at a shell after a command like <span class="blue">ls</span> that gets expanded by the 
   shell into a list of filenames. For example, to delete all the files with names that end in 
   <span class="orange">.o</span>, you'd type <b>rm *.o</b> (or in Windows, <b>erase *.o</b>). The shell has its own
   glob function that it calls to return a list of matching filenames to pass to the <span class="blue">rm</span> program. 
   In fact, early versions of Perl just called out to the shell to do the globbing for them. But the 
   shell's glob facility wasn't as powerful as the Perl developers wanted it to be, so they wrote their own. 
  You gotta love that ingenuity!</p>
   
  <p>If you're used to typing glob patterns at shell command lines, you're used to the glob metacharacters 
   already. But just in case, here's a list of the meanings of the most common ones:</p>
   
  <ul><li><span class="blue">*</span>: Zero or more characters.</li><li><span class="blue">?</span>: Exactly one character.</li><li><span class="blue">[abc]</span>: Any one of the characters <span class="blue">a</span>, <span class="blue">b</span>, or <span class="blue">c</span>.</li><li><span class="blue">[a-z]</span>: Any character in the inclusive range <span class="blue">a</span> through <span class="blue">z</span>
     (same rules as Perl regexes).</li><li><span class="blue">pattern1 pattern2</span>: The union of the result of <span class="blue">pattern1</span> and 
    <span class="blue">pattern2</span>.</li></ul>
   
  <p>This may seem a lot like regular expression syntax, but it isn't—for example, the period
   has no special meaning, <span class="blue">*</span> is the same as the regex <span class="orange">/.*/</span>, and <span class="blue">?</span> 
   is the same as the regex <span class="orange">/./</span>. Here are some examples of glob patterns and their 
   meanings:</p>
   
  <ul><li><span class="blue">*.p[lm]</span>: All files with names ending in <span class="blue">.pl</span> or <span class="blue">.pm</span>.</li><li><span class="blue">*/*~</span>: All files with names ending in <span class="blue">~</span> in subdirectories of the current 
    directory.</li><li><span class="blue">../*/spam?/in.mbx</span>: All files named <span class="blue">in.mbx</span> in all subdirectories named 
    <span class="blue">spam</span> followed by a single character in all sibling directories of the current directory.</li><li><span class="blue">/etc/rc[1-4].d/K1*</span>: All files with names starting with <span class="blue">K1</span> in subdirectories 
    <span class="blue">rc1.d</span>, <span class="blue">rc2.d</span>, <span class="blue">rc3.d</span>, and <span class="blue">rc4.d</span> of 
    <span class="blue">/etc</span>.</li></ul>
   
  <p>There is one giant exception to all of the rules and examples listed above though. <i>They do not match filenames 
   beginning with a period unless you explicitly include the period.</i> (This restriction does not apply to 
   <span class="darkgreen">readdir</span>.) This is the Unix way of trying to hide files. It's not particularly effective, 
   since you can get at the "hidden" files with the glob pattern <span class="blue">".*"</span>, and then match all files 
   with the glob pattern <span class="blue">"* .*"</span>.</p>
  
  <p>It might seem as though you need to qualify every glob search to match both kinds of files, but in 
   practice, you only use <span class="darkgreen">glob</span> to match files that couldn't possibly start with a 
   period. In other cases, you'll generally use <span class="darkgreen">readdir</span>. <span class="darkgreen">glob</span> is 
   handy when you want to find a list of files matching a pattern you can turn into a glob pattern; 
   with <span class="darkgreen">readdir</span> you would need to take the additional step of selecting candidates 
   based on a regular expression.</p>
   
  <p>Let's try an example using <span class="darkgreen">glob</span> now; create <span class="darkred">glob_read.pl</span> as shown:</p>
   
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE: glob_read.pl</div><div class="listing"><pre><ins>#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

print ".: $_\n"    for glob "*";

print "/etc: $_\n" for glob "/etc/*";</ins>
</pre></div></div>
   
  <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it.  It's the <span class="darkgreen">glob</span> 
   equivalent of <span class="darkred">dir_read.pl</span>, with the exception that it doesn't list files with names 
   beginning with periods, and so it omits <span class="orange">'.'</span> and <span class="orange">'..'</span> (among others).</p>
   
  <p>Let's try another short example using <span class="darkgreen">glob</span> in scalar context, with one of the 
   patterns that was used as an example above. Create <span class="darkred">glob_while.pl</span> as shown:</p>

<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE: glob_while.pl</div><div class="listing"><pre><ins>#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

while ( my $file = glob "/etc/rc[1-4].d/K1*" )
{
  print "Matching file: $file\n";
}</ins>
</pre></div></div>
   
  <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it.</p>
   
  
  
   
  <p>There's another part of the <span class="darkgreen">glob</span> pattern syntax that behaves a bit 
   differently. If you don't use any of the metacharacters listed above, Perl does no filename matching. 
   So, for instance, glob "nonesuch.pl" will return <span class="orange">"nonesuch.pl"</span>, regardless of whether 
   such a file exists in the current directory. Don't take my word for it though, try it yourself!
   Type a one-liner in the Unix shell as shown:</p> 
   
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE TERMINAL SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~$ <ins>ls -l nonesuch.pl</ins>
ls: nonesuch.pl: No such file or directory
cold:~$ <ins>perl -le 'print glob "nonesuch.pl"'</ins>
nonesuch.pl
cold:~$ 
</pre></div></div> 
  
  <p>It doesn't seem very likely that you would write a <span class="darkgreen">glob</span> pattern without any 
   expansion metacharacters, though, does it?</p>
   
  <p>Well, there are some metacharacters that do not trigger filename matching. Curly brackets surrounding
   strings, separated by commas, expand to the list of elements in brackets; so, for example, 
   <span class="orange">"{foo,bar}.pl"</span> is treated as <span class="orange">"foo.pl bar.pl"</span>, so that's the result you 
   will get regardless of whether those files exist.</p>
   
  <p>You can even use this facility as a quick-and-dirty way of generating permutations! Run this 
   one-liner:</p>
   
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE TERMINAL SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~$ <ins>perl -le 'print for glob "{a,b,c}{d,e}{f,g,h,i}"'</ins>
</pre></div></div>
   
  <p>If you want to use brackets in a <span class="darkgreen">glob</span> pattern and make sure that you only get results 
   that match filenames, insert any of the metacharacters <span class="blue">*</span>, <span class="blue">?</span>, or 
   <span class="blue">[]</span> outside of the braces to force a name check. For example, run these two one-liners and 
   observe the different results:</p>
  
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE TERMINAL SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~$ <ins>perl -le 'print for glob "{foo,bar}.pl"'</ins>
foo.pl
bar.pl
cold:~$ <ins>perl -le 'print for glob "{foo,bar}.p[l]"'</ins>
cold:~$ 
</pre></div></div>
 
  <p>The second pattern is exactly the same as the first one because there is only one character inside 
   the character class.</p>
   
  <p>To get details on the syntax of <span class="darkgreen">glob</span> patterns, run <b>perldoc File::Glob</b>.</p>
   
  <p><div class="c"><table class="noteBox fBox pBox "><tr><td class="noteTitle">Note</td><td class="note">In older Perl programs, it was common to use angle brackets (<span class="blue">&lt;&gt;)</span> as a synonym 
   for <span class="darkgreen">glob</span>. Perl is (usually) able to tell the difference between a filehandle and a 
   glob pattern and call <span class="darkgreen">readline</span> or <span class="darkgreen">glob</span> as necessary. This 
   practice can be confusing though, and isn't preferred now.</td></tr></table></div></p>

 <p>The range of useful programs you can write in Perl is dramatically broader than it was
  at the beginning of this course. You are now able to write Perl programs that can solve lots of the problems you encounter in 
  real life. Amazing! In the next and final lesson we'll create the biggest example program we've tackled
  yet!</p>
