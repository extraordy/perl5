  <p>If you're familiar with other computer languages, you've probably used a loop. In most other languages, there is a 
    <span class="purple">for</span> loop, which has three parts to its condition. Perl has a <b>for</b> loop as 
   well, and it works much the same way as in those other languages. But the 
   <span class="purple">foreach</span> loop is <i>much</i> more useful in Perl. A common mistake people make when learning Perl is to use the 
   <span class="purple">for</span> loop where the <span class="purple">foreach</span> loop would give their programs greater clarity.</p>
   
  <p>With that in mind, let's look at the <span class="purple">for</span> loop:</p>
  
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: for loop syntax</div><div class="observe"><pre>
<span class="purple">for</span> ( <span class="darkblue">Initialization</span>; <span class="darkred">condition</span>; <span class="darkgreen">iteration</span> )
{
  # ... code ...
}
</pre></div></div>
   
  <p>The <span class="purple">for</span> loop is characterized by the three clauses separated by semicolons inside 
   parentheses; we call it the "directive." Each clause is a single Perl expression. Here's what the clauses 
   do:</p>
   
  <ul><li><span class="darkblue">Initialization:</span> This is executed right before the first iteration of the 
    loop. It's typically used to set an index variable to its initial value.</li><li><span class="darkred">Condition:</span> This expression is evaluated in Boolean context (to see if it
    is true or false) before each execution of the loop. As soon as it evaluates as false, the 
    <span class="purple">for</span> statement terminates, just like a <span class="purple">while</span> statement would.</li><li><span class="darkgreen">Iteration:</span> This clause is executed at the end of each iteration of the 
    loop before the <span class="darkred"><i>condition</i></span> is tested again.</li></ul>
   
  <p>And though we love the <span class="purple">for</span> statement, it could be replaced by a  
   <span class="purple">while</span> statement that has this structure:</p>
   
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: while equivalent</div><div class="observe"><pre>
<span class="darkblue">Initialization</span>
<span class="purple">while</span> ( <span class="darkred">condition</span> )
{
  # ... code ...
  <span class="darkgreen">iteration</span>
}
</pre></div></div>
   
  <p>...except the <span class="purple">for</span> loop imposes its own scoping level on the directive, so that you 
   can declare variables in the Initialization with <span class="purple">my</span> and restrict their scope to 
   the <span class="purple">for</span> statement. So strictly speaking, the for loop is equivalent to this:</p>
   
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: while equivalent</div><div class="observe"><pre>
{
  <span class="darkblue">Initialization</span>
  <span class="purple">while</span> ( <span class="darkred">condition</span> )
  {
    # ... code ...
    <span class="darkgreen">iteration</span>
  }
}
</pre></div></div>
   
  <p>Now that you understand the operation of <span class="purple">for</span>, let's look at an example:</p>
   
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: for loop</div><div class="observe"><pre>
<span class="purple">for</span> ( <span class="darkblue">my $i = 0</span>; <span class="darkred">$i &lt;= $#array</span>; <span class="darkgreen">$i++</span> )
{
  print "Element $i is $array[$i]\n";
}
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p>Although a 
     <span class="purple">for</span> loop isn't a very good way to iterate through an array, it makes for a tidy example. 
     </p>
   <p>The expression <span class="red">$#array</span> evaluates to
   the index of the last element of the array <span class="red">@array</span>. So, if <span class="red">@fruits</span> contains the four 
   elements <span class="orange">apple, orange, banana, cherry</span>, then <span class="red">$#fruits</span> is <span class="orange">3</span>,
   and the value of the last element <span class="red">$fruits[$#fruits]</span> is <span class="orange">cherry</span>. Because it's 
   fairly common to want to access the last element of an array, and since that expression is cumbersome 
   and repetitive, Perl also allows you to use <i>negative</i> indices to count backwards from the 
   <i>end</i> of an array. So you get <span class="red">$fruits[-1]</span> <span class="blue">eq</span> <span class="orange">'cherry'</span> and 
   <span class="red">$fruits[-2]</span> <span class="blue">eq</span> <span class="orange">'banana'</span>.</p>
   
   <p>Try the <span class="purple">for</span> loop in a one-liner by typing the code below in the Unix shell as shown:</p>
   
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~$ <ins>perl -le 'push @sq, $_ ** 2 foreach 1 .. 9; for ( $i = 0; $i &lt;= $#sq; $i++ ) { print "Element $i is $sq[$i]" }'</ins>
Element 0 is 1
Element 1 is 4
Element 2 is 9
Element 3 is 16
Element 4 is 25
Element 5 is 36
Element 6 is 49
Element 7 is 64
Element 8 is 81
cold:~$ 
</pre></div></div>
   
  <p>The <span class="purple">for</span> loop is a bad way to iterate through an array because there's a good chance 
    of making a <i>fencepost error</i>. <i>Fencepost error</i> gets its catchy name from this question: "If 
   you have 100 feet of fencing to be used on a fence with posts spaced 10 feet apart, how many posts do you 
   need?" (Answer: 11. Think about it.) Does the operator in the condition need to be 
   <span class="blue">&lt;</span>, or <span class="blue">&lt;=</span>? Does the right side need to be <span class="red">$#sq - 1</span>, 
   <span class="red">$#sq</span>, or <span class="red">$#sq + 1</span>? Any time it takes you to come up with the correct answer is 
   too much—if you use the <span class="purple">foreach</span> loop to iterate through array elements, you don't 
   need to think about that at all.</p>
   
  <p>But, if you also need to know the <i>index</i> of an array element in the loop (as in the example 
    above), the <span class="purple">for</span> loop is at least concise. An alternative to using the <span class="purple">for</span> loop
   would be:</p>
   
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: array iteration</div><div class="observe"><pre>
{
  my $i = 0;
  <span class="purple">foreach my</span> <span class="red">$element</span> ( <span class="red">@array</span> )
  {
    print "Element $i is $array[$i]\n";
    $i++;
  }
}
</pre></div></div>
   
  <p>But you still have to think about the initial value of <span class="red">$i</span> and where to 
   put the postincrement operation in that example. </p>
   
  <p>Another <i>for</i> example is suggested by the <b>perldoc perlsyn</b> entry for the <span class="purple">for</span> loop. 
   Let's create a simplified version of it in <span class="darkred">prompt.pl</span> as shown:</p>
   
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE: prompt.pl</div><div class="listing"><pre><ins>#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

for ( prompt(); &lt;STDIN&gt;; prompt() )
{
  print "Input received: ";
  print;
  last if /Quit/i;
}

sub prompt { print "Input: " }
</ins></pre></div></div>
   
   <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it. Now type in lines of text at the prompt 
     until you get bored, then type a line containing the word "quit." (You can also end the program with 
     end-of-file on standard input, by typing a line beginning with Control-D, on Unix/Linux systems.)</p>
   
  <p>This example is a prototype for many applications where you need to prompt the user for input
    in a loop. By abstracting the prompting code into a subroutine, we minimize duplication. It also 
    demonstrates a few new topics. <span class="blue">STDIN</span> is the predetermined filehandle for input from the
    terminal (or wherever it has been redirected from), just like <span class="blue">STDOUT</span> and 
   <span class="blue">STDERR</span>.</p>
    
  <p>And just like <span class="purple">while</span> statements, if a readline 
   (<span class="blue">&lt;&gt;</span>) operator is the only thing in the condition of a <span class="purple">for</span> statement, 
   Perl assumes the code <span class="blue">defined $_ = </span> is in front of it.</p>
  
  <p>Finally, since the code for the <span class="blue">prompt</span> subroutine was short, I chose to put 
    it all on one line and  to omit the 
    semicolon at the end of the statement (layout rules don't have to be followed strictly if 
   clarity can be achieved by breaking them). Remember, semicolons are statement <i>separators</i> in Perl, not 
   statement <i>terminators</i>; you can omit them at the end of a block or the end of a file, but only where 
    the closing curly brace follows immediately on the same line.</p>
   
  <p>I'll share one last thought about <span class="purple">for</span> and <span class="purple">foreach</span> here. Compare
    the forms of the two statements:</p>
   
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: for vs. foreach</div><div class="observe"><pre>
<span class="purple">for</span> ( initialization; condition; iteration )
<span class="purple">foreach</span> [ loop_variable ] ( list )
</pre></div></div>
   
  <p>Perl can tell these two statements apart not just by the different keywords, but
   also by the presence of semicolons within the parentheses. Because <span class="purple">foreach</span> is so much 
   more useful than <span class="purple">for</span>, you'll type it more often. It would 
    make sense, then, to use a shorter keyword than <span class="purple">foreach</span> (this is a principle known as <i>Huffman</i> coding).  
   Therefore, Perl allows you to type <span class="purple">for</span> even when you mean <span class="purple">foreach</span>, and it will know 
   what you mean:</p>
   
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: foreach, spelled 'for'</div><div class="observe"><pre>
<span class="purple">for</span> [ loop_variable ] ( list )
</pre></div></div>
   
  <p>From now on, we'll use that form of the <span class="purple">foreach</span> loop (or postfixed modifier) to save on 
   typing and to illustrate the most common best practice.</p>

  <p>This relatively small topic becomes essential when you have nested loops and need to break out of an outer one.
   Suppose you have some Minesweeper game-like code that scans through a grid looking for a certain 
   element; create <span class="darkred">sweep.pl</span> as shown:</p>
  
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE: sweep.pl</div><div class="listing"><pre><ins>#!/usr/bin/perl

my @row1 = qw(O O O O O);
my @row2 = qw(O O O O O);
my @row3 = qw(O X O X O);
my @row4 = qw(O O X O O);

for my $row_index ( 0 .. 4 )
{
  my @row = $row_index == 0 ? @row0
          : $row_index == 1 ? @row1
          : $row_index == 2 ? @row2

          :                   @row4;
  for ( my $column_index = 0; $column_index &lt;= $#row; $column_index++ )

    if ( $row[$column_index] eq 'X' )

   <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it. Our program finds and reports the 
   coordinates of Xs. But which Xs is it reporting? The first X in each row that contains any Xs, because the
   <span class="purple">last</span> statement causes it to stop processing the inner loop when it finds an X. That's a 
   little confusing, because the output suggests to us that it's actually reporting on all of them. Now 
   suppose we want to find only the <i>first</i> X. And suppose the matrix is really large and we don't 
   want to spend time scanning it after finding the first X. When we find one X, we want to 
   stop processing <i>both</i> loops.</p>
   
  <p>But <span class="purple">last</span> only bails out of the innermost loop; that's going to cause problems—unless we 
   use a <i>loop label</i>. Modify the program as follows:</p>

  <p>Here's how labels work. A label is a bareword followed by a colon; by "bareword" I mean any string of 
   characters that would be legal after a <span class="red">$</span> or <span class="red">@</span> or <span class="red">%</span> for a variable name 
   that you declare with <span class="purple">my</span>. By universal convention, we restrict labels to uppercase 
   letters, underscores, and digits.</p>
   
  <p>Labels can only come before loop statements: <span class="purple">for</span>, <span class="purple">foreach</span>, 
   <span class="purple">while</span>, and <span class="purple">until</span>. </p>
   
  <p>Any loop control statement—<span class="purple">next</span>, <span class="purple">last</span>, 
   <span class="purple">redo</span>—can take a target that is the name of the label of an enclosing loop. Any 
   loops within the one that the control statement happens to be inside of, will be ignored for the purpose of 
   executing the control statement.</p>

  <p>Suppose you want to display a running count of operations performed so you can keep track of how far 
    you've gotten. Maybe each operation takes a while to perform, so you want to see the count so you can be sure 
   the program hasn't gotten stuck. Let's see a basic example of that; create <span class="darkred">progress.pl</span> 
   as shown:</p>
   
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE: progress.pl</div><div class="listing"><pre><ins>#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

for ( 1 .. 20 )
{
  long_operation();
  print "$_\n";
}

sub long_operation
{
  sleep 1;
}</ins>
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it. I introduced a new function here, 
   <span class="darkgreen">sleep()</span>, which takes as argument an integer number of seconds to pause, to 
   simulate a lengthy operation.</p>
   
  <p>So far, so good. But now suppose that <span class="blue">long_operation()</span> needs to print information of
    its own to the terminal occasionally. We'll simulate that with this change:</p>
   
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO EDIT: progress.pl</div><div class="listing"><pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

for ( 1 .. 20 )
{
  long_operation(<ins> $_ </ins>);
  print "$_\n";
}

sub long_operation
{
<ins>  my $arg = shift;

  print "Processing element $arg\n" unless $arg % 5;</ins>
  sleep 1;
}</pre></div></div>
  
   <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it.  The <span class="darkgreen">%</span> operator is 
   the <i>modulus</i> operator that returns the remainder when the left side is divided by the right side. 
   We use it here to print a line every five iterations. </p>
  
  <p>Now the tracking numbers are mixed up in the output with the other information. We'd really like 
   to see only the tracking numbers while the program is running, but when the program is done, 
   then see only the other information. That sounds magical! And in fact we recently learned something that 
   can make that happen. Remember the <span class="orange">\r</span> escape sequence for carriage return? It rewinds the 
   cursor to the beginning of the line. Make this change:</p>

<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO EDIT: progress.pl</div><div class="listing"><pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

for ( 1 .. 20 )

<ins>  print "$_\r";</ins>
}

sub long_operation
{
  my $arg = shift;

  print "Processing element $arg\n" unless $arg % 5;
  sleep 1;
}</pre></div></div>
  
   <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it. Oops. We got the output we wanted, but 
   we didn't see the tracking numbers at all! Why is that? In fact, they were being printed, but we didn't 
   see them in time as a result of <i>buffering</i>. The standard output stream is <i>line buffered</i> by Perl, 
   which means that nothing goes to the screen until Perl sees a newline (<span class="orange">\n</span>). So as Perl 
   gets each output string—<span class="orange">"1\r"</span>, <span class="orange">"2\r"</span>, <span class="orange">"3\r"</span>, and 
   <span class="orange">"4\r"</span>—it saves them up, and then when it sees 
   <span class="orange">"Processing element 5\n"</span>, it prints everything it's saved up to that <span class="orange">\n</span>. 
   This means that the cursor returned to the left side of the screen after printing each 
   <span class="orange">\r</span>, too fast for you to see it. And yet you had to wait five seconds for it to happen.</p>
  
  <p>We <i>really</i> don't want Perl to buffer the output. We can tell Perl what we want by setting 
   the magic variable <span class="red">$|</span> (that's a vertical bar) to a true value. Make this change:</p>
  
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO EDIT: progress.pl</div><div class="listing"><pre>

  print "Processing element $arg\n" unless $arg % 5;
  sleep 1;
}
</pre></div></div>
  
   <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it.  There is something very satisfying about 
   this basic, but effective mechanism.</p>
  
  <p><div class="c"><table class="noteBox fBox pBox "><tr><td class="noteTitle">Note</td><td class="note"> Perl will also flush its standard output buffer when you read a line from STDIN, which is why
   <span class="darkred">prompt.pl</span> was able to print a prompt that didn't include a newline. Perl does this 
    precisely to make it unnecessary to know about <span class="red">$|</span> in order to do prompting.</td></tr></table></div></p>

  <p>Another time unbuffering can be helpful is when you have redirected the standard output of your Perl 
   program to a file, and from another process you are monitoring that file with <span class="blue">tail -f</span> while 
   your program runs. When output is to a file, it is normally <i>fully</i> buffered, which means that output 
   won't be flushed until a large buffer fills up, usually about 8 kbytes big. A newline isn't sufficient to 
   force a flush. But setting <span class="red">$|</span> will unbuffer standard output again so that you can keep up with 
   your program's output with <span class="blue">tail -f</span>.</p>
