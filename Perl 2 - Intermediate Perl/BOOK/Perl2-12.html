 <a name="h_01"></a><div class="heading">String and Number Literals</div><div class="headingText">
   
  <p>We've talked before about some of the escape sequences that can be used within strings; we'll go 
   through them in detail in a minute, but first, a refresher on 
   number literals. Suppose you are defining the speed of light in meters per second:</p>
   
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: c</div><div class="observe"><pre>
<span class="red">$c</span> = <span class="orange">299792458</span>;
</pre></div></div>
   
  <p>That's difficult to verify visually. It would be all too easy to omit a digit or include an unnecessary 
   one. If we were writing—rather than coding—a large number like the speed of light, or the 
   national debt, or O'Reilly's student base, we would put <span class="orange">commas</span> at every third digit, like 
   this:</p>
   
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: c</div><div class="observe"><pre>
c = 299<span class="orange">,</span>792<span class="orange">,</span>458 m/s
</pre></div></div>
   
  <p>But that won't work in Perl because the comma is already taken. (In a list context, the comma separates list 
   arguments, and in a scalar context—like this would be—it evaluates the argument on the left 
   and then returns the argument on the right. If you're in a hurry, you can use a comma in a one-liner to run 
   multiple statements after an <span class="blue">and</span> or an <span class="blue">or</span> conditional, instead of resorting to an 
   <span class="purple">if</span> block.)</p>
   
  <p>But Perl does have a character you can use instead: the <span class="orange">underscore</span>:</p>
  
  <div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: c</div><div class="observe"><pre>
<span class="red">$c</span> = 299<span class="orange">_</span>792<span class="orange">_</span>458;
</pre></div></div>
   
  <p>This makes it much less difficult to verify that the number has the right magnitude.</p> 
   
  <p>Perl does not check to make sure you inserted underscores every third character; it is quite happy with 
   numbers like 299_79245_8, or 2_99_79_24_58, or even 2_9_9_7_9_2_4_5_8—this even works in floating 
   point numbers:</p>
   
  <div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: inappropriate use of underscores</div><div class="observe"><pre>
<span class="red">$pi</span> = <span class="orange">3.1_415_9</span>;
</pre></div></div>
   
  <p>Perl lets you insert the underscore anywhere except at the beginning, and issues a warning if you have two 
   underscores in 
   a row or one at the end. Underscore helps you to verify large 
   numbers by emulating the comma for grouping digits in threes. You might think that it would be 
   useful when partitioning numbers in a social security number or a telephone number to reflect their 
   customary grouping, but there's a problem with that. The grouping would be lost as the value was 
   passed around (Perl does not remember the location of underscores) and both kinds of numbers are 
   really strings, not numbers; you don't do arithmetic on them, 
   so why store them as numbers?</p>
   
  <p>You can also specify numbers in scientific notation with the exponent:</p>
   
  <div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: Avagadro's Number</div><div class="observe"><pre>
<span class="red">$a</span> = <span class="orange">6.0221415E23</span>;
</pre></div></div>
   
  <p>Don't put any spaces around the "E." You can use an upper-case E or a lower-case e.</p>
   
  <p>In addition to integers and floating point numbers, there are other types of numeric literals in 
   the decimal base. Perl allows the specification of numbers in other bases as well:</p>
   
  <div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: alternative bases</div><div class="observe"><pre>
<span class="red">$signature</span> = <span class="orange">0xfc45</span>;      # Hexadecimal
<span class="red">$mode</span>      = <span class="orange">0755</span>;        # Octal
<span class="red">$episode</span>   = <span class="orange">0b11001001</span>;  # Binary
</pre></div></div>
   
  <p>Hexadecimal numbers are introduced by <span class="orange">0x</span>, followed by one or more hexadecimal digits
   in either upper or lower case. The prefix may <i>not</i> be capitalized to <span class="orange">0X</span>.</p>
   
  <p>Octal numbers are introduced by a leading zero followed by one or more octal digits (<span class="orange">0</span>
   through <span class="orange">7</span>). <i>No letter <span class="orange">'O'</span> follows the zero.</i> The 
   reason for this apparent inconsistency is actually to be consistent with other languages, like C; the 
   decision dates back many years to when Perl needed to look familiar to programmers. This has 
   caused confusion for many novice Perl programmers; let's make sure it doesn't happen to you. 
   Run this one-liner. Type the code below in the Unix shell as shown:</p>
  
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~$ <ins>perl -le '$x = "0454"; print $x+1; $x = 0454; print $x+1'</ins>
455
301
cold:~$ 
</pre></div></div>
   
  <p>The first <span class="red">$x</span> is a <i>string</i>. Perl's rule for interpreting
   numbers in a string is based solely on the specification for a decimal number. Leading zeroes are 
   permitted because we might want to format reports with leading zeroes, and people would freak out if 
   Perl suddenly interpreted some of those numbers as octal. The second <span class="red">$x</span> is a literal number 
   (hard-coded in the program); there is no reason to put a leading zero in front of it, therefore Perl uses 
   the leading zero to denote that it's an octal number.</p>
   
  <p><b>String Escapes:</b> There are a number of escape sequences you can put inside of double-quoted strings. 
   You're already familiar with <span class="orange">\n</span> (newline) and <span class="orange">\t</span> (tab); there are 
   several others:</p>
   <br>
  <div class="c"><table class="tbl" border=""><tr><td>\r</td><td>Carriage return (more on this in the next lesson)</td></tr><tr><td>\f</td><td>Form feed (hardly useful any more)</td></tr><tr><td>\a</td><td>Alarm (ring the bell)</td></tr><tr><td>\e</td><td>The escape character (ESC)</td></tr><tr><td>\b</td><td>Backspace</td></tr><tr><td>\<i>nnn</i></td><td>Octal character <i>nnn</i> (each <i>n</i> is a digit from 0 through 7)</td></tr><tr><td>\x<i>nn</i></td><td>Hexadecimal character <i>nn</i> (each <i>n</i> is a digit from 0 through F, 
    uppercase or lowercase)</td></tr><tr><td>\c<i>c</i></td><td>Control character <i>c</i> (e.g., \cG is Control-G)</td></tr></table></div>
  <br> 
  <p>This list is incomplete; it does not contain Unicode characters, but they are outside the scope of 
   this course. The complete list can be found in <b>perldoc perlop</b>.</p>
   
  <p>These escape sequences only count when they are inside "double-quoted" strings, not 'single-quoted' strings.</p>
   
  <p>Some escape sequences don't get turned into control characters, but instead cause Perl to change what 
   follows them:</p>
   
  <ul><li><b>\l</b>: Lowercase next character.</li><li><b>\L</b>: Lowercase all characters until end of string or the sequence <b>\E</b>.</li><li><b>\u</b>: Uppercase next character.</li><li><b>\U</b>: Uppercase all characters until end of string or the sequence <b>\E</b>.</li><li><b>\Q</b>: Quote all regex metacharacters so they match only literally until end of string or the 
    sequence <b>\E</b>.</li></ul>
   
  <p>Escape sequences that don't have another meaning inside a regular expression can be used in a regex. 
   So, while <span class="orange">\b</span> can't be used to mean backspace in a regex (it's an anchor), 
   <span class="orange">\0<i>nn</i></span> and others can. Let's see how that works. Type the code below in the Unix shell as shown:</p>
   
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~$ <ins>perl -le 'print "Ding" if "\a" =~ /\cG/'</ins>

 </div>
 <a href="Perl2-12.html" name="character_functions"></a>
 <a name="h_02"></a><div class="heading">Character Functions</div><div class="headingText">
   
  <p>There are a couple of character functions that you should know. They aren't often used, but when the 
   time comes, you'll be glad you learned them.</p>
   
  <p><span class="darkgreen">chr( <i>number</i> )</span> returns the character with a numerical value that is
   <i>number</i>.  For example, <span class="darkgreen">chr( 65 )</span> is the letter <span class="orange">'A'</span> (unless 
   you're running Perl on an EBCDIC system, in which case you have bigger problems, like remembering where 
   you left your time machine :-) ). You can use <span class="darkgreen">chr( <i>number</i> )</span> as yet another 
   mechanism for generating Unicode characters; it's also handy for getting at accented characters in the 
   ISO Latin-1 extended character set. Try it out in a one-liner by typing the code below in the Unix shell as shown: </p>
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~$ <ins>perl -le 'printf "%o: %s\n", $_, chr foreach 0xA0 .. 0xFE'</ins>
</pre></div></div>
  
  
  <p>It doesn't work right; nothing prints for every character. Welcome to the world of character 
   encodings and fonts. It's an unfriendly place. The command above will work most places, but not in the 
   special environment that we have for students. The assembly of shells, SSH connections, Java 
   applets, and browser windows that combine to make the environment work for you, means that we have to lie to 
   Perl a little to get the output we want; we tell it that the output stream is in UTF-8 (this is covered in 
   <b>perldoc perlunitut</b>, but be warned, this is a confusing and complicated topic). Modify the code in the Unix shell as shown:</p>
  
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~$ <ins>perl -CO -le 'printf "%o: %s\n", $_, chr foreach 0xA0 .. 0xFE'</ins>
</pre></div></div>
  
  <p>(FYI, that's the letter O, not a zero, after the big C.)</p>
   
  <p>You can see here that the default variable for <span class="darkgreen">chr</span> is, naturally enough, 
   <span class="red">$_</span>. <span class="darkgreen">printf</span> does not get a newline appended to it by <b>-l</b>, 
   unlike <span class="darkgreen">print</span>, so we have to include it explicitly. Remember, we use
   <span class="darkgreen">printf</span> to output a number in an alternative base, like octal, hexadecimal, 
   or binary.</p>
   
  <p>Having found the character code you want, you can then use one of the escape sequences from the
   table above to print it out. Type the code below in the Unix shell as shown:</p>
   
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~$ <ins>perl -CO -le 'print "Welcome to our Internet caf\351"'</ins>
</pre></div></div>
  
  <p>Once again, if you try that on your own system, leave out the <span class="code">-CO</span>.</p>
  
  <p><span class="darkgreen">ord( <i>x</i> )</span> is the inverse of <span class="darkgreen">chr</span>: it returns 
   the numeric value of the character <i><span class="darkgreen">x</span></i>. (If you supply more than one character in the 
   string, Perl only looks at the first one.)  Try it in a one-liner by typing the code below in the Unix shell as shown:</p>
  
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~$ <ins>perl -le 'print ord "A"'</ins>
65
cold:~$

 </div>
 <a href="Perl2-12.html" name="number_functions"></a>
 <a name="h_03"></a><div class="heading">Number Functions</div><div class="headingText">
   
  <p>If you want to <i>print</i> a number in an alternative base, you use 
   <span class="darkgreen">printf</span> and the appropriate format descriptor. But what about the inverse? For 
   example, suppose you read a hexadecimal string in from a core dump, how would you turn it into the 
   equivalent number? </p>
   
  <p>Perl contains some handy functions for converting strings representing numbers in different bases.
   <span class="darkgreen">hex( <i>string</i> )</span> converts a hexadecimal string to its number. 
   Try it in a one-liner by typing the code below in the Unix shell as shown: </p>
 
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~$ <ins>perl -le 'print hex "af"'</ins>
175
cold:~$ 
</pre></div></div>
   
  <p>Try some other hexadecimal strings in place of <span class="orange">"af"</span>, like <span class="orange">"0xdd"</span>
   and <span class="orange">"DeadBeef"</span>.</p>
   
  <p><span class="darkgreen">oct( <i>string</i> )</span> converts an octal string to its corresponding number.   
   Try it in a one-liner by typing the code below in the Unix shell as shown:</p>
   
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~$ <ins>perl -le 'print oct "43"'</ins>
35
cold:~$

  <p>The <span class="darkgreen">oct</span> function can also convert strings with other radixes. 
   Try it in a one-liner by typing the code below in the Unix shell as shown:</p>
   
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~$ <ins>perl -le 'print oct for qw(0b101001 0755 0xFAA)'</ins>

    to use examples that only contained literal atoms.</p>

  <p>The first column above uses <b>P</b> and <b>E</b> as abbreviations for the pattern and expression, 
   respectively. (The pattern is <span class="orange">/[;:=]+\s*/</span> and the expression is 
   <span class="red">$_</span>.)</p>

  <p>Study that program, its output (as well as the list below) carefully until you understand how each line of 
   output was produced. You'll use the <span class="darkgreen">split</span> function often, so make sure 
   you're comfortable with it.</p>
   
  <p>There are many special cases in the operation of <span class="darkgreen">split</span>, so many that when we 
   go through them, it may seem overwhelming. Don't worry—you'll get the hang of them. These special cases serve 
   to make the operation of <span class="darkgreen">split</span> more intuitive, so in the end, you'll actually 
   have less to remember. Let's look at the 
   details of the operation of <span class="darkgreen">split</span>.</p>
   
  <ul><li>Empty leading fields are preserved; if I split <span class="orange">"::abc:def"</span> on <span class="orange">/:/</span>, 
    I'll get four elements in the list, the first two being empty.</li><li>Empty trailing fields are deleted; if I split <span class="orange">"abc:def::"</span> on <span class="orange">/:/</span>, 
    I'll get two elements in the list, <span class="orange">"abc"</span> and <span class="orange">"def"</span>.</li><li>If all the fields end up being empty, they're all deleted. Type this into the Unix shell as shown: </li></ul>

</pre></div></div> 
   
  <ul><li>Trailing empty fields are <i>not</i> deleted if a <i>LIMIT</i> is specified.</li><li>If you want to make sure that you get all trailing empty fields and don't want to have to guess at a 
    large enough <i>LIMIT</i>, use any negative <i>LIMIT</i>, such as <span class="orange">-1</span>. That splits into 
    as many fields as it would if there were no <i>LIMIT</i>, but leaves in trailing empty fields.</li><li>The empty regex (<span class="orange">//</span>) has a special meaning to <span class="darkgreen">split()</span>: split 
    the string into its characters. Type this into the Unix shell as shown: </li></ul>
     
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~/perl2$ <ins>perl -le 'print for split //, "Intermediate Perl"'</ins>
</pre></div></div>
    
  <ul><li>If you surround the pattern with grouping parentheses, Perl puts whatever matched the regex in the 
    output list, interwoven with the usual fields.</li></ul>
   
  <p>Let's take a look at that last rule in closer detail, because it describes something very useful: the 
   ability to save all the parts in between the output fields. Try this one-liner by typing this code into the Unix shell as shown:</p>
   
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~/perl2$ <ins>perl -le 'print foreach split /(\W+)/, "Fred,Bill&amp;Ted-Ten%Each...minimum\$100"'</ins>

  <p>Sometimes what comes between the fields needs to be saved as well. This feature of 
   <span class="darkgreen">split</span> lets you do it.</p>

   convenient. The <span class="darkgreen">each()</span> function acts as an <i>iterator</i> that returns a 
   two-element list of a key and its corresponding value. Each time you call it, you'll get a new 
   (key,value) until you've gone all the way through the hash, at which point it returns the empty list. 
   (In scalar context, <span class="darkgreen">each()</span> returns a key each time until it reaches the end, at 
   which point it returns <span class="orange">undef</span>. That won't be very useful.)</p>
   
  <p>This can save us an extra step when we want to put the value in its own variable to save on typing.
   Create <span class="darkred">each.pl</span> as shown:</p>

my (%description, %retail_price, %appearance);
my $MARKUP = 1.45;

while ( &lt;DATA&gt; )
{
  next if /\AItem ID/;
  my ($id, $desc, $cost, $color) = split /\s*\|\s*\$?/;
  $description{$id}  = $desc;
  $retail_price{$id} = $cost * $MARKUP;
  $appearance{$id}   = $color;
}

while ( my ($id, $desc) = each %description )
{
  printf "$desc : \$%.2f\n", $retail_price{$id};
}

  <p>We used the <span class="darkgreen">split</span>'s powerful regular expression to 
   deal with the inconsistent separator in the input data (sometimes it has space around it 
   and sometimes it doesn't), and to remove the dollar sign from the cost before multiplying it by 
   <b>$MARKUP</b>.</p>
   
  <p>The impact of <span class="darkgreen">each()</span> here is minimal (it saves us from typing
   <span class="red">$description{$id}</span>), but in certain programs, the
   <span class="darkgreen">each</span> function will be essential.</p>
  <p>Alright then. Good job! We're really picking up steam! See you in the next lesson...</p>
 
 </div>
  <a href="Perl2-12.html" name="read"></a>
 <a name="h_06"></a><div class="heading">read()</div><div class="headingText">
  <p>Our final topic for this lesson is the <span class="darkgreen">read()</span> function.  This is
   an input function, but it is
   more primitive than the <span class="darkgreen">readline</span> operator (<span class="darkgreen">&lt;&gt;</span>).
   Instead of reading until it gets to a newline, it reads a specified number of characters.  Can you think
   why that might be useful? Right—when reading binary data, the term we use for data that's not
   line-oriented. Usually it doesn't look like text, either, since text usually has line breaks in it so
   that people can read it. Binary files, like images, music, or proprietary document format files,
   usually contain characters that are unprintable and make a mess on your screen if you accidentally
   try to list them.
  </p>
  <p>It's rare that you'd want to read such a file into Perl (without using a module that's specialized
   to the task of parsing whatever format the file is in), but you need to know about <span class="darkgreen">read()</span>
   for such occasions.  Because if you read a giant binary file in using <span class="darkgreen">&lt;&gt;</span>,
   you may use huge amounts of memory unnecessarily since that binary file may not contain any newline characters.
  </p>
  <p>To do an interesting example of this requires that we read something from a binary file.  This
   image from earlier in the course will do. </p>
  
  <p><div class="c"><img src="images/lessonImages/regmatch.png"></div></p>
  
  <p>We'll extract the width of the image from it. The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/PNG/#11IHDR" target="_blank">PNG specification</a> tells us it's near
   the beginning, contained in the first four bytes after the string "IHDR." We can tell from the specification 
   that 50 bytes is more than enough
   to read to make sure we've read in that part of the file.  Create <span class="darkred">read_png.pl</span>:
  </p>
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE:</div><div class="listing"><pre><ins>#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

open my $fh, '&lt;', '/software/Perl2/regmatch.png' or die "Couldn't read file: $!\n";
read $fh, my $buffer, 50;
$buffer =~ /IHDR(....)/ and print "Width = $1\n";
</ins></pre></div></div>
  <p>The <span class="darkgreen">read()</span> function takes three arguments, the first being the filehandle to read from,
   the second a scalar to put the data into, and the third the number of characters to read.
   (Because we're not opening this file with a Unicode encoding, each character will be one byte long.)
   <img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it.  The output should be:
  </p>
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>
cold:~/perl2$ <ins>./read_png.pl</ins>
Width = ù</pre></div></div>
  <p>
   What happened?  Because we're reading binary data, the width is also in binary; it's a 32-bit number.  So 
   it came out to the terminal as junk.  There's a way
   we can look at it, using the Unix <b>od</b> utility, which will turn binary data into something we can read:
   </p>
  
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~/perl2$ <ins>./read_png.pl | od -c</ins>
0000000   W   i   d   t   h       =      \0  \0 001 371  \n</pre></div></div>
  
  <p>There you can see that the width is the four characters with octal  values 0, 0, 1, and 371. We still need
   to turn it into a number we can read. Perl's <span class="darkgreen">unpack</span> function will do that. It allows
   all kinds of conversions via <i>conversion specifiers</i> in a format string rather like <span class="darkgreen">printf</span>
   See the voluminous documentation for those specifiers in <b>perldoc -f pack</b>, which is the inverse function
   (that could be used for turning numbers into binary). The one we want is <b>%N</b>: "An unsigned long (32-bit) in 
   "network" (big-endian) order." Edit <span class="darkred">read_png.pl</span>:</p>
  
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE:</div><div class="listing"><pre>#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

open my $fh, '&lt;', '/software/Perl2/regmatch.png' or die "Couldn't read file: $!\n";
read $fh, my $buffer, 50;
$buffer =~ /IHDR(....)/ and print "Width = <ins>", unpack( "%N", </ins>$1<ins> ), "</ins>\n";
</pre></div></div>
  <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it.  The output should be:
  </p>
  
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~/perl2$ <ins>./read_png.pl</ins>
Width = 505</pre></div></div>
 </div>
 <p>And we're done!  (You can view that image locally to verify that it is indeed 505 pixels wide).
  (If you really wanted to read PNG files, the proper approach would be to use the module <b>Image::PNG</b>;
  this was just a simple example to illustrate <span class="darkgreen">read()</span>.)
 Most people deal with binary data rarely if at all, so we are not going to explore the <span class="darkgreen">pack</span>
 function further, but feel free to read up on it if you might be one of those people who needs to read or write
 binary data.</p>
