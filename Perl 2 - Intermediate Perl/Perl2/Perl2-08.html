  <p>Hi and welcome back! In this lesson, you'll learn about using <span class="red">$_</span> with regexes, <i>grouping</i> (how to 
   treat several atoms as though they were a single atom; you'd think the term for this would be "molecule," 
   but it isn't), and alternation (how to match one of several choices). Then we'll try some examples 
   of parsing with regexes.</p>
  
  <a name="h_01"></a><div class="heading">$_ and regexes</div><div class="headingText">
   
   <p>Our previous examples have been more long-winded than they needed to be. So far we've always matched a regex against 
    an explicitly named input using the binding operator (<span class="blue">=~</span>). But there is a default 
    variable available for regex matching—no prizes for guessing what it is! When you have a regex that is not 
    bound to any variable via <span class="blue">=~</span>, it will match against <span class="red">$_</span>. We introduced 
    regexes in the course by incorporating a hypothetical function called <span class="darkgreen">regmatch</span>. When 
    you call <span class="darkgreen">regmatch</span> with only one argument, <b>regmatch( $regex )</b>, 
    instead of two, <b>regmatch( $regex, $input )</b>, it's as though <span class="red">$_</span> is the second argument, 
    <b>regmatch( $regex, $_ )</b>.</p>
   
   <p>What does that look like?  Let's do an example! Copy <span class="darkred">reg_capture4.pl</span> from the 
    previous lesson and modify it:</p>
   
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO EDIT: reg_capture4.pl</div><div class="listing"><pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

<del>while ( my $line = &lt;DATA&gt; )
{
  chomp $line;
  if ( $line =~ /(.*),\s+(\w\w)\s+(\d{5})/ )</del>
<ins>while ( $_ = &lt;DATA&gt; )
{
  chomp;
  if ( /(.*),\s+(\w\w)\s+(\d{5})/ )</ins>
  {
    my ($city, $state, $zip) = ($1, $2, $3);
    printf "City: %-20s; State: $state; Zip: $zip\n", $city;
  }
}

   <p>Again, we don't declare <span class="red">$_</span> with <span class="purple">my</span>; it doesn't belong to us, it 
    belongs to Perl. And the default variable for 
    <span class="darkgreen">chomp()</span> is <span class="red">$_</span>.</p>
   
   <p>We'll make even better use of <span class="red">$_</span> as we proceed in this lesson.</p>

   <p>One problem we've run into when applying quantifiers is that we can only apply them to something that 
    matches a single character. When I introduced the <span class="orange">?</span> quantifier with the example 
    <span class="orange">apples?</span>, you may have thought, "Hmm, there are lots of plural forms that won't be able to use this quantifier. What about 
    words that are made plural by adding 'es'?"</p>
   
   <p>Fortunately, capturing parentheses have a helpful side-effect that we can take advantage of here. They <i>group</i> 
    everything between them so that it effectively becomes an atom. That means that if you put a quantifier 
    after a parenthesis group, it applies to everything in the group. So to match <span class="orange">"wrench"</span>
    or its plural, you can write <span class="orange">/wrench(es)?/</span> (or, if you also want to match serving maids, 
    <span class="orange">/wr?ench(es)?/</span>).</p>
   
   <p>There's one disadvantage here though. If we are capturing parts of the input to use in <span class="red">$1</span> or some other quantifier as well, 
    then introducing a parenthesis group solely for the purpose of forming an atom to be quantified, will
    throw off our counting: <span class="red">$1</span> may become <span class="red">$2</span>, for instance. We need 
    <i>noncapturing</i> parentheses: parentheses that will form a group, but not capture to a numbered variable. Perl 
    does have them, but they look a bit weird. After the opening parenthesis we have to add <span class="orange">?:</span>, like 
    this: </p>
   
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: noncapturing parentheses</div><div class="observe"><pre>
<span class="orange">(?:<i>regex</i>)</span></pre></div></div>

   <p>Let's try an example. Suppose you're capturing US zip codes, some of which 
    might be five-digit codes like <span class="orange">95472</span>, and some of which might be ZIP+4 codes like 
    <span class="orange">95472-2811</span>. Create <span class="darkred">reg_zip.pl</span> as shown:</p>
   
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE: reg_zip.pl</div><div class="listing"><pre><ins>#!/usr/bin/perl

use warnings;

while ( $_ = &lt;DATA&gt; )
{

  /(\d{5}(?:-\d{4})?)/ and print "Found zip: $1\n";

   <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it.  See how it finds and captures both types 
    of zip code?  Let's dissect the regex <b><span class="red">/(\d{5}(?:-\d{4})?)/&gt;</span></b>: </p>
   
   <div class="c"><table class="tbl" border="" cellspacing="15" cellpadding="15"><tr><td><span class="orange">(</span></td><td>Begin a group capturing to <span class="red">$1</span></td></tr><tr><td><span class="orange">\d{5}</span></td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;Match five digits</td></tr><tr><td><span class="orange">(?:</span></td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;Begin a noncapturing group</td></tr><tr><td><span class="orange">-</span></td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Match a hyphen</td></tr><tr><td><span class="orange">\d{4}</span></td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Match four digits</td></tr><tr><td><span class="orange">)</span></td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;Close noncapturing group</td></tr><tr><td><span class="orange">?</span></td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;Quantify noncapturing group as optional</td></tr><tr><td><span class="orange">)</span></td><td>End capturing to <span class="red">$1</span></td></tr></table></div>
   
   <p>The inner parentheses are noncapturing, so no <span class="red">$2</span> is created. This could be especially 
    helpful later on if we have inputs with text occurring after the zip code that we want to capture,

   <p>Sometimes we want to match one thing <i>or</i> another. Suppose we want to match one of a number 
    of fruit. We could use Perl's Boolean || operator; create <span class="darkred">reg_or.pl</span> as follows:</p>
   
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE: reg_or.pl</div><div class="listing"><pre><ins>#!/usr/bin/perl

while ( $_ = &lt;DATA&gt; )

  print "Captured: $1\n" if /(apple)/ || /(banana)/ || /(cherry)/;
}

You are the apple of my eye
Time flies like an arrow; fruit flies like a banana
I have cherry in stock

Captured: apple
Captured: banana
Captured: cherry
Captured: banana
cold:~/perl2$ 
</pre></div></div>   
      
   <p>This is not a bad approach, but its capabilities are limited.</p> 

   <p>Suppose we wanted to match a phrase of the form "I have &lt;fruit&gt; 
    in stock," and capture the fruit; now we have to write <span class="orange">/I have (apple) in stock/</span> 
    <span class="blue">||</span> <span class="orange">/I have (banana) in stock/</span> <span class="blue">||</span> <span class="orange">/I have (cherry) in 
     stock/</span>.</p> 
   
   <p>The repetition here makes the expression nearly unreadable. Try it in the program and see:</p>
   
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO EDIT: reg_or.pl</div><div class="listing"><pre>#!/usr/bin/perl

   <p>The regular expression language provides a solution with the <i>alternation</i> operator. 
    It looks familiar; it's a single vertical bar (<span class="blue">|</span>) and it means "or."
    Remember, this vertical bar is being used <i>inside</i> a regular expression; even though it is  
    being used to mean "or," it's <i>not</i> the same as the boolean operator we used in <span class="darkred">reg_or.pl</span>!<br>
   Now rewrite the program to handle the second match we were trying to make:</p>
     
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO EDIT: reg_alt.pl</div><div class="listing"><pre>#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

while ( $_ = &lt;DATA&gt; )
{
  chomp;
  print "Captured: $1\n" if <del>/(apple|banana|cherry)/</del><ins>/I have (apple|banana|cherry) in stock/</ins>;
}

__END__

cold:~/perl2$ 
</pre></div></div>
    
   <p>Our examples show that the <i>scope</i> of the alternation operator is to the nearest enclosing parentheses, or the edges of 
    the regex if there are no enclosing parentheses.</p>
     
   <p>If we didn't have the <span class="orange">\b</span> anchor available to us, we might rewrite
      <span class="orange">/\b\d{5}\b/</span> as <span class="orange">/(?:\A\d{5}\D\D|\d{5}\z|\A\d{5}\z)/</span>. But
      I think you'll agree that <span class="orange">\b</span> is a lot better!</p>
     
   <p>Let's do another example.  Create <span class="darkred">reg_alternate.pl</span> as shown:</p>
     
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE: reg_alternate.pl</div><div class="listing"><pre><ins>#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

while ( $_ = &lt;DATA&gt; )
{
  chomp;
  /\b(\S+berr(?:y|ies))/ and print "Enfruitened: $1\n";
}

__END__

   <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it.</p> 

<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE TERMINAL SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~/perl2$ <ins>./reg_alternate.pl</ins>

</pre></div></div>   
   
   <p>The inner parenthesis group in the 
    regex—<span class="orange">(?:y|ies)</span>—does not <i>need</i> to be noncapturing (take out the 
    <span class="orange">?:</span> and rerun the program and see for yourself). But it is  
    good <i>practice</i> to make sure you <i>never</i> use capturing parentheses, unless you use the numbered variable that 
    is created. Many programmers, upon reading a regex and encountering a capturing group, automatically 
   look for the use of the corresponding numbered variable and become frustrated if they don't find 
    it.</p>
     
   <p><div class="c"><table class="noteBox fBox pBox "><tr><td class="noteTitle">WARNING</td><td class="note">Perl tests alternation possibilities from left to right, and stops at the first 
    match. If a later alternative would produce a longer match, it won't be found after an earlier 
    match has already succeeded. So the regex <span class="orange">/\d{5}|\d{5}-\d{4}/</span> would <i>never</i> match a 
    ZIP+4 zip code, because the first alternative (<span class="orange">\d{5}</span>) will always succeed first. Switch 
    the order of the alternatives!</td></tr></table></div></p>
  
  </div>
  <a name="h_04"></a><div class="heading">Complete Parsing</div><div class="headingText">
    
   <p>Now we'll use your new regex skills to parse text files with some of Perl's most common
     idioms. </p>
   
   <p><b>$_ and &lt;&gt;</b> Remember the programmer's motto: Don't Repeat Yourself. You've already seen
    code in these forms:</p>
    
   <div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: line input idiom</div><div class="observe"><pre>
<span class="purple">while</span> ( <span class="darkgreen">defined</span>( <span class="purple">my</span> <span class="red">$line</span> = &lt;DATA&gt; ) )
<span class="purple">while</span> ( <span class="darkgreen">defined</span>( <span class="red">$_</span> = &lt;DATA&gt; ) )
</pre></div></div>
    
   <p> And we've learned that this code can be shortened using a special case of the <span class="purple">while</span> statement. 
    If the condition contains an assignment from the readline operator, then Perl will 
    <i>implicitly</i> wrap the assignment in <span class="darkgreen">defined()</span> for you. So you can write the 
    lines above like this:</p>
   
   <div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: line input idiom</div><div class="observe"><pre>
<span class="purple">while</span> ( <span class="purple">my</span> <span class="red">$line</span> = &lt;DATA&gt; )
<span class="purple">while</span> ( <span class="red">$_</span> = &lt;DATA&gt; )
</pre></div></div>
    
   <p>But wait—it gets better! If there is a readline operator, but <i>no</i> assignment to a variable, Perl 
    will <i>implicitly</i> assign to <span class="red">$_</span> for you. So the second line above can be written just 
    like this:</p>
    
   <div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: line input idiom</div><div class="observe"><pre>
<span class="purple">while</span> ( &lt;DATA&gt; )
</pre></div></div>
    
   <p>Now <i>that's</i> succinct. And it applies to the use of the readline operator on <i>any</i>
     filehandle, including the magic behavior with <i>no</i> filehandle:</p>
    
   <div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: line input idiom</div><div class="observe"><pre>
<span class="purple">while</span> ( &lt;&gt; )
</pre></div></div>
    
   <p>A <i>very</i> common pattern in Perl programs is: </p>
    
   <div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: Perl filter pattern</div><div class="observe"><pre>
<span class="purple">while</span> ( &lt;&gt; )
{
  <span class="darkgreen">chomp;</span>
  <span class="purple">if</span> ( <span class="orange">/<i>regex</i>/</span> )
   {
     # Do something with match
   }
}
</pre></div></div>
    
   <p>Let's try an example. Create <span class="darkred">grep.pl</span> as show:</p>
   
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE: grep.pl</div><div class="listing"><pre><ins>#!/usr/bin/perl

</ins></pre></div></div>
    
   <p>Our examples are getting <i>shorter</i>. That is very cool.</p> 
   
   <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it.  This is the world's shortest 
    implementation of the famous Unix <i>grep</i> program. You have <i>grep</i> available in your shell; try 
    it out if you're not already familiar with it:</p>
    
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE TERMINAL SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~/perl2$ <ins>grep perl ./*.pl</ins>

<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: invocation</div><div class="observe"><pre>
./grep.pl <i>regex</i> <i>files</i>
</pre></div></div>
    
   <p>The first argument is the regex to match and the remaining arguments are the search files (omit them if 
    you want to search standard input, for instance, if this is part of a shell pipeline). Okay, now try this:</p>
    
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE TERMINAL SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~/perl2$ <ins>./grep.pl '\bw\w' ./*.pl</ins>
