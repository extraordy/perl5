  <p>Welcome to the second lesson in this course on regular expressions! If this course is your first encounter with 
   regexes, be very excited! You're learning a brand new language <i>and</i> a whole new way 
   that computers get the job done. If you don't yet feel your brain expanding, check in with it again in a 
   lesson or two.</p>
   
  <p>Time to go beyond the basic literal matching we've done so far with 
   regexes. You remember that square brackets are special inside a regex, right? Now you'll find out why. Square brackets 
   in a regex indicate that the regex engine should match <i>any one of the 
    characters</i> between the square brackets. This is called a <i>character class</i>.</p>

  <p><div class="c"><img src="images/lessonImages/charclass.png"></div></p>
   
  <p>Let's create a quick program to help you learn by example! Create <span class="darkred">reg_charclass.pl</span> as shown:</p>
  
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE: reg_charclass.pl</div><div class="listing"><pre><ins>#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

my @strings = qw(pot pout pet sip nit snip spit);
my @regexes = qw(p[aeiou]t [snp]i[tp]);

printf "%10s%13s%13s\n", 'Regex:', @regexes;
foreach my $text ( @strings )
{
  printf "%10s", $text;
  foreach my $regex ( @regexes )
  {
    if ( $text =~ /$regex/ )
    {
      printf "%13s", "  X  ";
    }
    else
    {
      printf "%13s", "";
    }
  }
  print "\n";
}</ins></pre></div></div>
   
  <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it. The output should look like a text 
   version of this:</p>
  
  <div class="c"><table class="tbl" border=""><tr><th align="CENTER">Regex:</th><th align="CENTER">p[aeiou]t</th><th align="CENTER">[snp]i[tp]</th></tr><tr><td align="CENTER">pot</td><td align="CENTER">X</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td align="CENTER">pout</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td align="CENTER">pet</td><td align="CENTER">X</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td align="CENTER">sip</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td align="CENTER">X</td></tr><tr><td align="CENTER">nit</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td align="CENTER">X</td></tr><tr><td align="CENTER">snip</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td align="CENTER">X</td></tr><tr><td align="CENTER">spit</td><td align="CENTER">X</td><td align="CENTER">X</td></tr></table></div>
   
  <p>Let's go through each test in that table in turn:</p>
   
  <ul><li><b>pot</b> matches <span class="orange">/p[aeiou]t/</span> because the <b>p</b> matches literally, the <b>o</b> matches the <b>o</b> 
    in the character class <b>[aeiou]</b>, and the <b>t</b> matches literally.</li><li><b>pout</b> does not match <span class="orange">/p[aeiou]t/</span> because the regex requires that after matching the 
    literal <b>p</b> and <i>one</i> of the characters <b>a</b>, <b>e</b>:, <b>i</b>, <b>o</b>, or <b>u</b>, that we then match a <b>t</b>. But 
    we don't have a <b>t</b> in the input; we have a <b>u</b>. Remember, a character class matches <i>exactly</i> one 
    of the characters between the square brackets.</li><li><b>pet</b> matches <span class="orange">/p[aeiou]t/</span> the same way that <b>pot</b> did.</li><li><b>sip</b> matches <span class="orange">/[snp]i[tp]/</span> by matching the <b>s</b> in <span class="orange">[snp]</span>, then the 
    literal <b>i</b>, then the <b>p</b> in <span class="orange">[tp]</span>.</li><li><b>nit</b> matches <span class="orange">/[snp]i[tp]/</span> by matching the <b>n</b> in <span class="orange">[snp]</span>, then the 
    literal <b>i</b>, then the <b>t</b> in <span class="orange">[tp]</span>.</li><li><b>snip</b> matches <span class="orange">/[snp]i[tp]/</span> <i>starting</i> at the <b>n</b>, matching [snp], then the 
    literal <b>i</b>, then the <b>p</b> in <span class="orange">[tp]</span>. (In fact, the regex engine will first match the <b>s</b> 
    with <span class="orange">[snp]</span>, but when the next character is not a literal <b>i</b>, it will <i>backtrack</i> 
    and start from the beginning of the pattern again.) </li><li><b>spit</b> matches <span class="orange">/[snp]i[tp]/</span> by a similar process. It also matches 
    <span class="orange">/p[aeiou]t/</span>.</li></ul>
   
  <p>Check out these useful character classes:</p>
   
  <ul><li><span class="orange">[aeiou]</span>—a vowel. (Or <span class="orange">[aeiouy]</span> if you prefer.)</li><li><span class="orange">[0123456789]</span>—a digit.</li><li><span class="orange">[abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz]</span>—a lower-case letter.</li></ul>
  
  <p>Those last two examples are a bit long, don't you think? Something that useful shouldn't be that hard 
   to type. And if I'd left out the digit <span class="orange">6</span> or the letter <span class="orange">q</span>, I bet you 
   wouldn't have noticed. Perl offers a shortcut for making ranges of letters or digits in a character 
   class: a hyphen between two letters or two digits means <i>pretend that all the letters or digits in 
    between had been typed there</i>. So the last two examples above would come down to this:</p>
   
  <ul><li><span class="orange">[0-9]</span></li><li><span class="orange">[a-z]</span></li><li>And another example: <span class="orange">[A-Z]</span> (uppercase letters)</li></ul>
  
  <p>Much better! For now you only want to use this when the characters on each side are 
   either both letters (of the same case) or both digits. (Full details are available in 
   <b>perldoc perlre</b>, but you have to wade through a lot to find it—definitely not for the faint of heart.) If 
   you want a literal hyphen in a character class, make it the last character before the closing square 
   bracket; then you don't have to worry about it being interpreted as a range.</p>
   
  <p>But wait, it gets better (and by "better", I mean "more complicated...but also more useful")! If the 
   caret symbol is the <i>first</i> thing in a character class after the opening square bracket, it 
   <i>negates</i> the class, meaning that the class now matches any character <i>except</i> the ones 
   listed. So now we have this: </p>
   
  <ul><li><span class="orange">[^0-9]</span>—any character that is <i>not</i> a digit</li><li><span class="orange">[^a-zA-Z]</span>—any character that is <i>not</i> an upper- or lower-case letter</li></ul>
   
  <p>The caret symbol has several different meanings in regular expressions depending on where it's used,
    so pay careful attention each time you encounter a new use for it.</p>
  
 </div>
 <a name="h_02"></a><div class="heading">Character Class Shortcuts</div><div class="headingText">
   
  <p>If you thought <span class="orange">[0-9]</span> was a short idiom for matching a digit, you haven't fully
   appreciated just how <i>lazy</i> Perl programmers can be! (Laziness—the good kind—is one of 
   the three principal virtues of a Perl programmer as defined by Larry Wall. The other two are 
   <i>hubris</i> and <i>impatience</i>.) Perl defines some convenient shortcuts for certain common character 
   classes. Because you'll use them so often, they're just two characters long (with one 
   exception that's even shorter).</p>
   
  <div class="c"><table class="tbl"><tr><th>Instead of</th><th>You can type</th></tr><tr><td><span class="orange">[0-9]</span></td><td align="CENTER"><span class="orange">\d</span></td></tr><tr><td><span class="orange">[^0-9]</span></td><td align="CENTER"><span class="orange">\D</span></td></tr><tr><td><span class="orange">[a-zA-Z0-9_]</span></td><td align="CENTER"><span class="orange">\w</span></td></tr><tr><td><span class="orange">[^a-zA-Z0-9_]</span></td><td align="CENTER"><span class="orange">\W</span></td></tr><tr><td><span class="orange">[ \n\t\f\r\v]</span></td><td align="CENTER"><span class="orange">\s</span></td></tr><tr><td><span class="orange">[^ \n\t\f\r\v]</span></td><td align="CENTER"><span class="orange">\S</span></td></tr><tr><td><span class="orange">[^\n]</span></td><td align="CENTER"><span class="orange"><b>.</b></span></td></tr></table></div>
   
  <p>Let's take these one at a time!</p>
   
  <ul><li><span class="orange">\d</span> matches any digit.</li><li><span class="orange">\D</span> matches any character that is <i>not</i> a digit.</li><li><span class="orange">\w</span> stands for "word character"; it matches any upper- or lower-case letter, 
    digit, or underscore.</li><li><span class="orange">\W</span> matches any character that is <i>not</i> a "word" character.</li><li><span class="orange">\s</span> matches any character that is "white space." The escape sequences after the 
    space character in the character class <span class="orange">[ \n\t\f\r]</span> stand for newline, tab (you know 
    those already), form feed, and carriage return. Those are some odd characters, but they 
    all have the distinction of not putting any actual ink on a page or pixels on a screen. You will use 
    this shortcut a lot.</li><li><span class="orange">\S</span> matches any character that is not white space. (That's backslash capital S.)</li><li><span class="orange"><b>.</b></span> is a special shortcut that matches any character except for a newline. That one 
    is used so often in regular expressions that it was worthy of being only one character long. (Remember in 
    the last lesson that the "period" was one of the special characters in a regex? Now you know why. If you 
    want to match a literal period, backslash it.)</li></ul>
   
  <p>Now it's time to see some of those shortcuts in action! Create <span class="darkred">reg_charclass2.pl</span> as 
   shown:</p>
   
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE: reg_charclass2.pl</div><div class="listing"><pre><ins>#!/usr/bin/perl

  <p>When you're matching something like a zip code,
   you might think that a pattern of <span class="orange">/\d\d\d\d\d/</span> (like we have above) is adequate under 
   all circumstances, and then be surprised when it matches an input like <span class="orange">"Pi is approximately 
    3.14159265"</span>. When you step back and look at the input, you see that the regex is 
   matching <span class="orange">14159</span>. But you know that zip codes are only (in this example, anyway) five 
   characters long, and you might think that the regex should reject any input with more than five consecutive 
   digits. Of course, it doesn't. In order to do that, you'll need a feature that we'll introduce later.</p>
   
  <p>Most of the time, you won't have to worry about that though, because your input will not be completely 
   unpredictable and unstructured. It's usually only in class examples that you see matching done against 
   conversational text like in the above code. Generally, in real-world problems, the input data is more 
   constrained; for instance, any group of five consecutive digits in this particular input data could 
   only be a zip code.</p>
   
  <p>The pattern matching the declaration of a variable only needs to match the first part of a 
   variable name. We don't know how long a variable name will be, but we know it's going to start with a 
   letter after the sigil (that is, a symbol created for a specific "magical purpose," like $, @, or %), 
   so as long as we match that much, we're fine. We backslashed the <b>$</b>  
   to avoid having Perl think we were trying to interpolate a variable in the character class at that point, 
   and then we backslashed the <b>@</b> and <b>%</b> sign purely for the sake of symmetry, so readers of our code don't 
   wonder about the different treatment—in fact, the <b>@</b> and <b>%</b> do not need to be backslashed. 
   We need to put <span class="orange">A-Za-z</span> in the character class because if we leave one range out and use 
   the <span class="orange">/i</span> modifier instead, Perl would accept <span class="orange">MY</span> as a match for the 
   <span class="orange">my</span> earlier in the regex.</p>
   
  <p>And there's something more in that program—it contains its own input data! We did that so we 
   wouldn't have to create a separate data file for input, and to show the special filehandle <span class="red">DATA</span>. 
   That input filehandle is automatically opened by Perl when you have a line in your program 
   consisting precisely of the seven characters <span class="orange">__END__</span> (underscore, underscore, E, N, D, 
   underscore, underscore) followed by a newline. At that point, Perl stops compiling your program, and 
   everything after that point will be available through the <span class="red">DATA</span> filehandle. (Of course, you 
   don't <i>have</i> to read it. Usually people put the documentation for their code there so it 
   doesn't get compiled.) </p>
  
  <p><div class="c"><table class="noteBox fBox pBox "><tr><td class="noteTitle">Note</td><td class="note"> The actual definitions of <span class="orange">\d</span> and <span class="orange">\w</span> are broader than is 
   stated above, but that difference only matters when you are matching against characters outside the 
   standard ASCII set. Certain Unicode characters also match those shortcuts in recent versions of Perl. 
   For the sake of simplicity, we will continue to assume that <span class="orange">\d</span> is equivalent to 
   <span class="orange">[0-9]</span>, but in the event that your input string contains Unicode and you intend 
   to use the match in a numeric context, you should use <span class="orange">[0-9]</span> instead.

  <p>When I said that the pattern <span class="orange">/\d\d\d\d\d/</span> would match <span class="orange">"Pi is approximately

   Wouldn't it be great if Perl could show us what it matched? Well, it can, if we use the

  <p>You use it just like the match operator. We'll explore that in more depth in a future lesson; for now, 
   just be aware that it <i>changes</i> the variable it is bound to by swapping whatever <i>regex</i> matched
