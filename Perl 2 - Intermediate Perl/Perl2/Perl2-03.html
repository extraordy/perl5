   <p>This morning, I had cereal for breakfast. First I got the cereal out, then I put the cereal in a bowl, 
    then I added milk to the cereal, and then I put some fruit on top of the cereal. Finally, I ate the 
    cereal.</p>
   
   <p>What's wrong with that paragraph? It needlessly repeats the word "cereal" everywhere, as though it were
    an advertisement crafted by the Council on Carbohydrates. People don't talk like that. We'd be more likely 
    to say something like "This morning, I had cereal for breakfast. First I got it out, then I put it in a 
    bowl, then I added milk, and then I put some fruit on top. Finally, I ate it." In other words, we use the 
    <i>pronoun</i> "it" to avoid repeating something that's understood, and sometimes we can even leave out 
    the pronoun as well, where the context makes clear what we're referring to. </p>
   
   <p>Perl has something similar to the pronoun "it"—a <i>default</i> variable that is the implied target of many 
    operators and built-in functions in Perl. If you do not specify a variable, 
    the functions and operators are executed on the default variable. That variable is <b>$_</b>, 
    and it is the single most important 
    variable in Perl. You <i>must</i> know explicitly which operators and functions use $_; do not 
    assume or guess. We'll go over the 
    most common uses of <b>$_</b> in this course.</p>
  
  <p>Let's get started by taking a look at some examples of those operators that commonly use <b>$_</b>:</p>
   
  <p><b>print()</b>: The default thing to print is <b>$_</b>:</p>
   
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: print and $_</div><div class="observe"><pre>
print;
print {$fh};
</pre></div></div>
   
  <p>The first statement above will print whatever is in <b>$_</b> to the currently selected filehandle (by default, 
   standard output). The second statement prints whatever is in <b>$_</b> to the filehandle <b>$fh</b>.</p>
   
   <p><b>foreach()</b>: The default loop variable in foreach() statements is <span class="darkblue">$_</span>:</p>
   
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: foreach and $_</div><div class="observe"><pre>
foreach ( @fruit )
{
  # Do something with <span class="darkblue">$_</span>
}
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p>Technically, this is not the same as <b>foreach my $_ ( @fruit )</b> because you can't say
    <b>my $_</b>—the variable does not belong to you, it belongs to Perl. But you can think of it 
    that way. (Alright, in the 
    very latest versions of Perl you <i>can</i> say <b>my $_</b>, but don't do it until you know a whole lot 
    more about variables—for now just trust me on that.)</p>
   
  <p>To illustrate what you can expect in terms of the scoping of <b>$_</b> as the implicit variable in a 
   foreach loop, create <b>foreach.pl</b>. Type the code below as shown:</p>
   
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE:</div><div class="listing"><pre><ins>#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

$_ = "Outer\n";

print;

foreach ( "  Inner1\n", "  Inner2\n", "  Inner3\n" )
{
  print;
}

print;</ins></pre></div></div>
   
  <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it.</p>
  <p> The output illustrates that the 
    previous ("Outer") value of <b>$_</b> was restored after the loop.</p>
   
   <p><b>defined() and length()</b>: Two of the functions that operate on a single scalar 
    and use <b>$_</b> by default. </p>
  
  <p>It's not uncommon to use them both in a single 
    expression. Suppose you want to know whether a variable (let's say, $input) is not the empty 
    string. You might start out by writing <b>stringtest.pl</b> as shown:</p>
   
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE: stringtest.pl</div><div class="listing"><pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

my $input = '';
if ( $input ) 
{
  print "\$input is not the empty string\n";
}   
else
{
  print "\$input is the empty string\n";
}
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p>But that's no good, because the string "0" has a positive length (of one), yet it is false. Modify 
    <b>stringtest.pl</b> as shown:</p>
   
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE: stringtest.pl</div><div class="listing"><pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

my $input = '<ins>0</ins>';
if ( $input ) 
{
  print "\$input is not the empty string\n";
}   
else
{
  print "\$input is the empty string\n";
}
</pre></div></div>
   
  <p>Whoops. So next you might try this modification to your <b>stringtest.pl</b> code:</p>
   
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE: stringtest.pl</div><div class="listing"><pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

my $input = '0';
if ( <ins>length </ins>$input ) 
{
  print "\$input is not the empty string\n";
}   
else
{
  print "\$input is the empty string\n";
}
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p>Hmm. It's still not enough, because it's possible that <span class="darkblue">$input</span> has never 
    been initialized and 
    still contains <span class="darkred">undef</span>. Okay then, modify <b>stringtest.pl</b> as shown:</p>
  
   <div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE: stringtest.pl</div><div class="listing"><pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

my $input<del> = '0'</del>;
if ( length $input ) 
{
  print "\$input is not the empty string\n";
}   
else
{
  print "\$input is the empty string\n";
}
</pre></div></div>
   
    <p>That time you got a warning "Use of uninitialized value $input in 
    length." You don't want any warnings, so you need to test to determine whether the value is defined before you test its 
    length. You can do that by modifying your code as shown:</p>
   
   <div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE: stringtest.pl</div><div class="listing"><pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

my $input;
if ( <ins>defined( $input ) &amp;&amp; length( $input )</ins><del>length $input</del> ) 
{
  print "\$input is not the empty string\n";
}   
else
{
  print "\$input is the empty string\n";
}
</pre></div></div>

   <p>(This time we added parentheses for readability, but it works just the same without them.)</p>
   
   <p>If the variable you're testing is <span class="darkblue">$_</span>, you can write this:</p>
   
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: testing $_</div><div class="observe"><pre>
if ( defined &amp;&amp; length )
{
  do_something();
}
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p>The alternative postfixed conditional form of that would be:</p>
   
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: testing $_</div><div class="observe"><pre>
do_something() if defined &amp;&amp; length;
defined &amp;&amp; length and do_something();
</pre></div></div>
 
  </div>
  <a name="h_02"></a><div class="heading">More Postfixed Modifiers</div><div class="headingText">
   
   <p>Now that we've been introduced to <span class="darkblue">$_</span> and the postfixed conditionals, 
    let's talk about a new 
    postfixed statement modifier: <b>foreach</b>. Here's its general form:</p>
   
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: postfixed foreach</div><div class="observe"><pre>
<i>statement</i> foreach <i>list</i>;
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p>You don't need curly brackets or parentheses around the list. <i>But</i> you cannot
    specify a loop variable; it is forced to be $_. Let's start out with a quick example. Modify 
    <b>foreach.pl</b> as shown:</p>
   
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO EDIT: foreach.pl</div><div class="listing"><pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

$_ = "Outer\n";

print;

<del>foreach ( "  Inner1\n", "  Inner2\n", "  Inner3\n" )
{
  print;
}</del>
<ins>print foreach "  Inner1\n", "  Inner2\n", "  Inner3\n";</ins>
    
print;
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it.</p>
   <p>You get the same result. Like the 
    postfixed conditionals, this statement is <i>syntactic sugar</i> for the statement we had earlier that contained 
    the curly braces and parentheses. You don't have to use this form of <b>foreach</b>; you can always 
    stick to the longer one if you want, even when there's only one statement in the block. Here's 
    another example:</p>
   
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: postfixed foreach</div><div class="observe"><pre>
print "$_: $count{$_}\n" foreach <span class="darkgreen">sort</span> <span class="darkred">keys</span> %count;
</pre></div></div>
   

   <p>That one is so common that it's an idiom in its own right, and you'll use it in a program
   later in this lesson. The most common thing to want to do with a 
   hash is to dump it out in some predictable ordering so you can look at its contents. You'll likely use a 
   line like that frequently (if only during development) so you can verify the contents of a hash. (The 
   predictability comes from using <span class="darkgreen">sort</span> on the list of keys, which are otherwise 
   returned in an effectively random order from <span class="darkred">keys</span>.)</p>
   
   <p>While we're learning the postfixed <b>foreach</b>, let's also look at the postfixed <b>while</b>. Its 
    general form is: </p>
   
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: postfixed while</div><div class="observe"><pre>
<i>statement</i> while <i>condition</i>;
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p>Again, no braces, and no parentheses necessary around the condition. As you might have guessed, 
    this also is syntactic sugar for the longer form. There is also a 
    postfixed <b>until</b>:</p>
   
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: postfixed until</div><div class="observe"><pre>
<i>statement</i> until <i>condition</i>;
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p>Let's look at an example that copies the standard input to the standard output, prefixed 
    with line numbers. Create <b>number.pl</b> as shown:</p>
   
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE:</div><div class="listing"><pre><ins>#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

my $line;
my $count = 1;
printf "%5d %s", $count++, $line while defined( $line = &lt;STDIN&gt; ); </ins>
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it.  Now type the code below 
    into the Unix Window that's running <b>number.pl</b>:</p>
   
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE TERMINAL SESSION</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~$ <ins>cd perl2</ins>
cold:~/perl2$ <ins>./number.pl &lt; ./number.pl</ins>
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p>Most programs of this type (a text <i>filter</i>) use <b>&lt;&gt;</b> to read input, 
    but now I want to introduce you to a new, <i>predefined</i>, filehandle: <b>STDIN</b>. Perl sets this up for 
    you, open to the standard input, so you can read from it. You may wonder why it's a word instead of a 
    scalar, like, for example, $STDIN? It's because STDIN originates from a much earlier version of Perl that didn't 
    have filehandles in scalars. When filehandles in scalars were introduced, the Perl maintainers 
    decided to keep the old name of <b>STDIN</b> around so as not to break older programs. 
    They also decided not to introduce new scalar variables like $STDIN, because doing so might break 
    older programs that used that variable for something else.</p>
   
   <p>There are two predefined output filehandles, named <b>STDOUT</b> and <b>STDERR</b>, opened to the 
    standard output and standard error streams respectively.</p>
   
   <p>Let's wrap this up with one more example. First, copy the file <a href="gettysburg.txt" target="_blank">gettysburg</a>  
    to your current directory. This contains the text of Lincoln's <i>Gettysburg Address</i>, and it will be 
    interesting input to the program we are about to write. Then, create <b>word_counter.pl</b> by typing the code below as shown:
   </p>
   
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE: word_counter.pl</div><div class="listing"><pre><ins>#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

my %count;
while ( $_ = &lt;&gt; )   # See note below
{
  my @words = split;
  $count{$_}++ foreach @words;
}

print "$_: $count{$_}\n" foreach sort keys %count;
</ins></pre></div></div>
   
   <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it in the terminal window as shown below:</p>
   
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE TERMINAL SESSION</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~/perl2$ <ins>./word_counter.pl ./gettysburg.txt</ins>
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p><table class="noteBox fBox pBox "><tr><td class="noteTitle">Note</td><td class="note">This program explicitly assigns to $_ in the <b>while</b> condition. Don't start using that idiom 
    in your own programs! Within a few lessons, you'll see how to replace that with a much better 
    alternative.</td></tr></table></p>
  
   <p>The program counts the number of occurrences of every word in the files named on the command line. You 
    can run it on any text file; <i>The Gettysburg Address</i> just happens to provide a data set that's interesting 
    and not too big for our purposes.</p>
   
   <p>Another new element in this example is that there are <i>no</i> arguments to 
    the <span class="darkgreen">split</span> function. The second argument (what to split) defaults to, you guessed 
    it, $_. And the first argument (the token to split on) defaults to white space. So this makes a decent 
    first approximation of a word finder. You wouldn't want to use it in any application that took a 
    linguistic view of the concept of "word," because it does nothing to eliminate punctuation, for 
    example.</p>
   
   <p>And if you think <i>that</i> program was succinct, it can be made even shorter by
    eliminating a temporary variable. Modify your code as shown:</p>
 
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO EDIT: word_counter.pl</div><div class="listing"><pre>#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

my %count;
while ( $_ = &lt;&gt; )   # See note above
{
<del>  my @words = split;
  $count{$_}++ foreach @words;</del>
<ins>  $count{$_}++ foreach split;</ins>
}

print "$_: $count{$_}\n" foreach sort keys %count;
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.JPG"> and run it in the terminal window as shown:</p>
   
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE TERMINAL SESSION</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~/perl2$ <ins>./word_counter.pl ./gettysburg.txt</ins>
</pre></div></div>

   <p>You'll see the same results.</p>
   
  </div>
  
  <p>Some programmers don't like <b>$_</b> because they believe that every variable in a program should be visible 
   and explicit. And certainly if you're using <b>$_</b>, the big advantage in doing so <i>is</i> gained by using it 
   implicitly (in functions and operators that use it as a default). That makes for code that is more readable 
   by virtue of its succinctness (think back to the paragraph about cereal). It defeats the usefulness of 
   <b>$_</b> to mention it explicitly, over and over. Still, you usually can't avoid mentioning it here 
   and there. A good rule of thumb is that the number of implicit uses of <b>$_</b> in a section of code 
   should exceed the number of explicit uses. </p>
  
  <p>If you don't like the idea of <b>$_</b> to begin with, then you don't need to use it. But because 
   <b>$_</b> is a very <i>Perlish</i> notion (based on patterns of natural language), you <i>do</i> need to 
   understand it because you will encounter it in virtually every Perl program ever written. And 
   we will be using it a lot throughout the rest of this course! If you think I'm joking about how Perlish 
   <b>$_</b> is, check out this T-shirt design the Portland Perl Mongers considered for 2010:</p>
