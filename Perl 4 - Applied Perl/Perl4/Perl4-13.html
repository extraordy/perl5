 <p>Welcome back! In this lesson we're going to take a good look at <i>asynchronous processing:</i> code that lies outside 
  the normal flow of control in your program. You've encountered asynchronous processing before in signal 
  handlers and exceptions; but now we'll take it a step further by writing code 
  to create the illusion that your computer is executing more than one task at a time. (Unless your computer uses multiple core processors, 
  it can't execute more than one task at a time, but it can switch between 
  tasks rapidly.)</p>

  <p>The process model of computing as implemented on all versions of Unix is fairly straightforward. It 
   relies on two system functions: <b>fork</b> and <b>exec</b>. <b>fork</b> creates an exact copy of the 
   current process; <b>exec</b> replaces the image in the current process with one derived from running a given 
   program. Perl provides interfaces to those functions with the same names. Let's look at those two 
   functions in detail.</p>
  
  <a name="s_01"></a><div id="s_01"><div class="subheading">Using fork()</div><div class="subheadingText">
   
   <p>In Christopher Nolan's 2006 movie <i>The Prestige,</i> the protagonist—a magician—uses a 
    machine to create an exact duplicate of himself, complete with all of his memories and thoughts. 
    This is a pretty good analogy for how <b>fork()</b> works. After a call to <b>fork</b> 
    there are two identical processes executing the same code: the original process, which is called the parent, 
    and a child process, which inherits the data, state, and filehandles of the parent. If the child had a mind, it would 
    think it had been executing all along, just the way the parent process had. (Whoa—now there's some deep 
    existentialist thought for you to ponder!)  </p>
   
   <p>There is one asymmetry within these processes though: the parent-child relationship. When the child 
    finishes executing, a signal is delivered to the parent process. The parent needs to call <b>wait</b> to 
    access the return status of the child process, or the child may become a "zombie," a process that just 
    hangs around waiting for someone to acknowledge that it is dead (analagous to quite another kind of 
    movie!). This won't happen on all versions of Unix, but it's good defensive programming to assume 
    that your code will be run on such a system at some point. </p>
   
   <p>When you run an external program via <b>system</b>, Perl does a <b>fork</b>; in the child, Perl does an 
    <b>exec</b> to replace the process image with that of the target program, then exits. Because the child 
    inherits the parent's filehandles, anything the child prints goes to the same place that the parent's 
    standard output goes.</p>
   
   <p>The documentation for this section can be found in 
    <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/perlipc.html" target="_blank">perldoc perlipc</a> and 
    <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/5.12.0/functions/fork.html" target="_blank">perldoc -f fork</a>. This is a 
    complex and difficult subject; our study of multiprocessing will consist of a broad overview. 
    If you want to take on more intensive work with process forking, you'll want to study specific issues like
    signals, filehandles, buffering, and especially race conditions, to be confident in your 
    implementation.</p>
   
   <p>Let's get going and try an example using <b>fork()</b>. Create a new file named <b>/perl4/forktest.pl</b>, as shown:</p>

   <p>The process IDs that are printed for you will be different, and more importantly, the order of the 
    lines while both processes are running may be different too. You could run this program 100 times and 
    see the same order each time, but that doesn't guarantee that the order will be the same the 101st time. 
    This is one of the fundamental caveats of programming for concurrency: the rates at which concurrent 
    processes proceed may vary arbitrarily.  The operating system is perfectly within its rights to make 
    one of those processes wait any amount of time while it handles something more important that's happened.  
    Most of the time, you won't see noticeable variation, which makes multiprocessing debugging especially 
    treacherous; one day some variation 
    will happen, cause a problem, and then you will be unable to reproduce it. The best 
    defense is to understand about concurrency issues such as deadlock and race conditions, because
    testing that can flush out those problems is extremely difficult.</p>
   
   <p>Keep in mind that the moment <b>fork</b> happens successfully, 
    there are <i>two</i> processes executing at exactly that same spot in the code: the return of 
    <b>fork</b>. The only way to tell the difference between them is by the return value of <b>fork</b>, 
    which is the process id of the child in the parent, and zero in the child (and undef if there was a 
    problem forking, such as no available process slots—a serious problem). (Actually, there is one 
    other way to tell; you could save the value of the special variable $$, the current process id, and look 
    for a change, but we'll keep it simple for now.)</p>
   
   <p>Once the child process starts to execute, it has all of the same data as the parent, but they are 
    <i>copies:</i> if the child changes the value of any variable, that change only happens in the child, 
    not the parent, and vice-versa.</p>
   
   <p>In our example, we didn't <b>wait</b> for the child or trap signals; if the parent process exits 
    shortly after the child does, it's not necessary. If the parent process exits before the child does, 
    the operating system will assign the child to another process—a sort of foster home—that will 
    do the <b>wait</b> for you. Let's see that concept in action with a small change to <b>forktest.pl</b>:</p>

   <p>When the parent calls <b>wait</b>, it <i>blocks</i> (the technical term for "waits for something to 
    happen") until the child exits, at which point <b>wait</b> returns with the process id of the child 
    that just exited. That return code is stored in $?, left shifted by eight bits (the bottom eight bits are 
    used to store information such as whether the child dumped core, and if it was terminated by a signal, 
    the number of that signal). $? is also used to store the exit code of any command you run with 
    <b>system</b> or backticks. (We haven't covered the bit shift operators in our courses, but I'm confident you can find  
    information on any unfamiliar operators.)</p>
   
   <p>Notice that the child no longer prints the "After fork" line—it exited before it got there. You'll 
    almost always want to call <b>exit</b> in the block of child-specific code. Usually there will be 
    much more code following the <b>if</b> block that only makes sense for the parent to execute. And if the 
    <b>fork</b> is in any kind of a loop, continuing to execute that in the child would mean that the child 
    would then <b>fork</b> a copy of itself, which would eventually <b>fork</b> a copy of itself, and this would continue 
    until the system ran out of resources to create new processes. This can be a 
    quick way of crashing a system, so be careful to avoid it!</p>
   
   <p>If you want parent and child to be able to exchange more data than the one-way exit code that you see 
    above, you need to explore <i>interprocess communication</i>. This is an involved and complicated 
    topic (see <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/perlipc.html" target="_blank">perldoc perlipc</a>, preferably in small doses). 
    One of the most common methods of 
    exchanging data is through <i>bidirectional pipes</i>.</p>
   
   <p>Having your parent pause to <b>wait</b> on its child defeats the purpose of parallel 
    processing somewhat: you'd like the parent to be able to move on to tasks other than blocking. This is 
    where signals come in handy. Modify <b>forktest.pl</b> again, this time to make the parent continue executing 
    after the child is done:</p>

   <p>When the child process is ready to exit, it sends the CHLD signal to the parent, which causes the 
    currently running code (counting down) to be interrupted while it runs the signal handler we created 
    (<b>local</b> ensures that the handler is removed when leaving the current block scope, a good defensive 
    practice). The signal handler runs, at which point <b>wait</b> can execute without blocking, and then 
    the parent returns to the code it was previously executing.</p>

  <p>For more information on multiprocessing with fork and interprocess communication, I  
   recommend Lincoln Stein's book, "Network Programming with Perl." And in order to 
   do advanced multiprocessing tasks (like spawning a daemon) you'll need to 
   understand the underlying process model in more detail than we have gone into here. For that, I recommend  
   chapters 6, 7, and 11 of "The Design of the Unix Operating System," by Maurice J. Bach.</p>

 <a name="h_02"></a><div class="heading">Multitasking</div><div class="headingText">
   
  <p>Computer people love to debate the interpretation of terms like 
   "multitasking." We're going to use the term here in the sense of executing multiple independent tasks within 
   the same process, without employing threads. An example of this model is the <i>event loop:</i> code that 
   sets up callbacks to be called when some external event happens, and then loops, waiting for any one of 
   them to happen. The best example of an event loop is a windowing system like the one you're looking at right 
   now. This particular windowing process is sitting in a tight loop waiting for you to press a key, move the mouse, or 
   click a button, at which point it will execute code that determines what to do with that event.</p>
  
  <a name="s_01"></a><div id="s_01"><div class="subheading">Beginning POE</div><div class="subheadingText">
   
   <p>Now we're ready to explore event loops in Perl with POE, the Perl Object Environment. (It's an odd title, 
    because POE is more about event processing than objects, but that's what it's called.) Let's install it first:</p>
   
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE TERMINAL SESSION: Command to type</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~/perl4$ <ins>PERL5LIB=~/mylib/lib/perl5 cpan POE</ins>
[output omitted]</pre></div></div>
      
   <p>When asked, do not install the temporary module, and skip the network tests.</p>
   
   <p>POE is <i>huge</i>. It's more of an operating system than a module. So it's best suited for 
    large, complex applications that are actually more like "systems" than "programs." We won't develop 
    anything that large in this course; trust me—it would be way too labor intensive for our purposes here.
    The quintessential POE application is a chat bot that carries on conversations with multiple users while 
    fetching the answers to their questions about the stock market. You would be pretty annoyed if you had to 
    type and read that much code!</p>
   
   <p>So our examples will look like they use an excessive amount of programming overhead to do something 
    relatively simple; be aware that when you write something of a more appropriate scale for the use 
    of POE, that overhead will be more reasonable. </p>

   <p>At its heart, POE is running off of a <b>select</b> call, which you can look up with 
    <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/CGI.html" target="_blank">perldoc -f select</a>. 
    (There are two different <b>select</b> functions; I'm referring 
    to the one that takes four arguments.) That means it can wait for input or output from various sources 
    we have declared. (POE can wait for other types of events, too, such as timers going off.) We can, for 
    instance, start an I/O request in one task, do something else, and then return to the first task when
    the input we have requested arrives. If you read the documentation for <b>select</b>, you will be 
    grateful for anything that makes using it easier!</p>
     
   <p>When I said that POE was like an operating system, I was at most half joking. POE has a <i>kernel</i> 
    that is a finite state machine that receives inputs and dispatches messages. You declare your interest 
    in certain types of events and specify what code to run when they happen. There is a layer of indirection 
    involved such that you don't directly link a coderef to an input event, but instead give the name of a
    "state" that in turn is linked to your coderef. Let's do an example! Create a new file as shown:</p>
     
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE: poetest.pl</div><div class="listing"><pre>#!/usr/local/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

use lib "$ENV{HOME}/mylib/lib/perl5";
use POE qw(Wheel::FollowTail);

my $file = shift or die "Usage: $0 &lt;file&gt;\n";
{ open my $fh, '&lt;', $file or die "Cannot open $file: $!\n" }

POE::Session-&gt;create(
  inline_states =&gt; {
    _start =&gt; sub {
      $_[HEAP]{tailer} = POE::Wheel::FollowTail-&gt;new(
        Filename   =&gt; $_[ARG0],
        InputEvent =&gt; 'handle_input',
        ErrorEvent =&gt; 'handle_error',
        SeekBack   =&gt; 0,
      );
    },
    handle_input =&gt; sub { print "Input: $_[ARG0]\n" },
    handle_error =&gt; sub { warn shift },
  },
  args =&gt; [$file],
);

$poe_kernel-&gt;run();
</pre></div></div>
     
   <p><img src="images/coderunner/save.gif"> Save it as <b>poetest.pl</b>. This program will monitor a 
    file for new content and do the equivalent of "tail -f" on it. Before you run the program, open a new 
    Terminal window by clicking the Terminal icon <img src="images/coderunner/Terminal.png"> and logging in 
    again. A new terminal window will appear in a new tab labeled <b>Terminal2</b> 
    (assuming the existing Terminal tab was labeled <b>Terminal1</b>):</p> 
   
   <p><div class="c"><img src="images/coderunner/TwoTerminals.gif"></div></p>
   
   <p>To differentiate between the two tabs you now have opened, the commands you type in Terminal2 will 
    be shown in <span class="purple">purple</span>. We'll also change the prompt to give you another visual cue:</p>
     
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE TERMINAL SESSION: Commands to type</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~$ <span class="purple">PS1="cold:\w(2)\$ "</span>
cold:~(2)$ <span class="purple">cd perl4</span></pre></div></div>
     
   <p>Now, in Terminal1, create the destination file and run the program:</p>
     
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE TERMINAL SESSION: Commands to type</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~/perl4$ <ins>touch testfile</ins>
cold:~/perl4$ <ins>./poetest.pl testfile</ins>
</pre></div></div>
     
   <p>At this point, the program in Terminal1 will block. Go to Terminal2 and start appending
      lines to testfile:</p>
     
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE TERMINAL SESSION: Commands to type</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~/perl4(2)$ <span class="purple">echo "Hello world" &gt;&gt; testfile</span>
cold:~/perl4(2)$ <span class="purple">sleep 1</span>
cold:~/perl4(2)$ <span class="purple">ls -l | head -2 &gt;&gt; testfile</span>
cold:~/perl4(2)$ <span class="purple">sleep 1</span>
cold:~/perl4(2)$ <span class="purple">date &gt;&gt; testfile</span></pre></div></div>
  
   <p>The output of your commands is echoed in Terminal1 as you run them in Terminal2. 
    There may be a delay before the first one shows up. We haven't given the POE program a reason to exit, 
    so stop it with <b>Ctrl+C</b> in Terminal1 when you finish.</p>
     
   <p>How does this work?  Take a deep breath, this is going to take a bit of explanation. The <b>use POE</b> statement loads not only the POE module, 
    but the POE::Wheel::FollowTail module as well; this is a convenient function of POE for reducing the 
    amount of text you need to type for <b>use</b> statements.</p>
     
   <p>We verify that we can open the input file for reading. This statement is inside a naked block so that 
    the lexical filehandle goes out of scope and automatically closes the file when the block exits—we only 
    opened the file to make sure that we could.</p>
     
   <p>Next, we create a POE <i>session</i> that will listen for and handle the events of content being added 
    to a file. Rather than create POE code from scratch to accomplish that (which would be prohibitively 
    tedious for this class), we use the existing module, POE::Wheel:FollowTail. (There POE modules for all kinds of operations
    that you might want to embed in a POE application; CPAN has over a thousand 
    of them.) </p>
     
   <p>The <b>inline_states</b> parameter specifies the names of events and the code that handles them. The 
    special event <b>_start</b> is called when the session is created, and is used to initialize the session. 
    At that point, this session instantiates a new POE::Wheel::FollowTail object; the arguments 
    to its constructor specify in turn the name of the file to be tailed, the names of the events 
    corresponding to an input being received and an error occurring, and how far back in the file to look 
    initially (our example doesn't look back at all). The documentation for this object can be found at 
    <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?POE::Wheel::FollowTail" target="_blank">http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?POE::Wheel::FollowTail</a>.</p>
     
   <p><b>ARG0</b> is a POE constant that specifies the first user argument passed to a POE callback. POE 
    uses array offsets instead of named parameters for faster code execution, and names constants like this 
    one (it's a subroutine that returns an integer) to recover the advantage of addressing parameters by 
    name instead of number.</p>
     
   <p>The next two states are the handle_input and handle_error we just named, and the callbacks to execute 
    when they occur. Finally, we specify the arguments for the session, which will be passed to the _start 
    callback when the session is created. The argument we specify is the input filename, which ends up 
    being $_[ARG0] in the _start handler.</p>
     
   <p>The heap (accessed through the parameter $_[HEAP] in any POE callback) is a place to store arbitrary 
    data. It is a hashref. We store our session on the heap so that it will have the right lifetime (it 
    will be destroyed when this session finishes). </p>
     
   <p>Our last step is (always) to run the POE kernel, which starts the session and waits for events to 
    dispatch.</p>

   <p>Now let's see how POE can be used for a different application, a TCP server. We'll implement the most 
    basic kind of server, one that simply echoes back everything it receives. We can use the Unix 
    <b>telnet</b> program to test it. Create a new file named <b>/perl4/poe_tcp.pl</b> as shown:</p>
   
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO ENTER:</div><div class="listing"><pre>#!/usr/local/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

use lib "$ENV{HOME}/mylib/lib/perl5";
use POE qw(Component::Server::TCP);

sub S_HND { return POE::Wheel::SocketFactory::MY_SOCKET_HANDLE }

POE::Component::Server::TCP-&gt;new(
  ClientInput =&gt; sub {
    my ($heap, $input) = @_[HEAP, ARG0];
    print "Read from client: $input\n";
    $heap-&gt;{client}-&gt;put( "You said: $input" );
  },
  Started =&gt; sub { my $sock = $_[HEAP]{listener}[S_HND];
                   my ($port) = Socket::sockaddr_in( getsockname($sock) );
                   print "Listening on port $port\n" },
);

$poe_kernel-&gt;run();
</pre></div></div>
    
   <p><img src="images/coderunner/save.gif"> Save and run it in 
    the Terminal1 tab:</p>
    
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE TERMINAL SESSION: Command to type</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~/perl4$ <ins>./poe_tcp.pl</ins>
Listening on port <i>51712</i></pre></div></div>
    
   <p>The port number will almost certainly be different now, and will probably change each time you run the program. 
    In the Terminal2 tab, telnet to that port (enter the number you saw in Terminal1 instead of 
    the one in <i>italics</i> below):</p>
    
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE TERMINAL SESSION: Commands to type</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~/perl4(2)$ <span class="purple">telnet localhost <i>51712</i></span>
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to localhost.
Escape character is '^]'.
<span class="purple">Hello, POE!</span>
You said: Hello, POE!</pre></div></div>
    
   <p>Every line you type in Terminal2 will be repeated back to you by the server, and logged in Terminal1. 
    Once again, use <b>Ctrl+C</b> in Terminal1 to end the program.</p>
    
   <p>How does this work? It looks fairly different than it did before, but many of the same things are 
    taking place. POE::Component::TCP
    is at a higher level than a POE session, but it ends up creating a session to listen to a socket. The 
    ClientInput callback is called when input is received over the socket; the input is passed in $_[ARG0].  
    On the heap at key <b>client</b> is a POE::Wheel::ReadWrite object representing the socket that we're 
    listening on; calling the <b>put</b> method on it sends text back to the client. </p>
   
   <p>To make the lines of code shorter, I created the S_HND subroutine as an alias to the subroutine 
    that gives the index of the socket handle in the listener object on the heap. The code for returning the 
    port we connected on is unnecessarily complex; there really ought to be a method in the component for 
    returning it, but there isn't one. The examples on the net for this component all use explicitly named 
    port numbers. But if we did that, and two students ran this program at the same time, one would 
    get an error, so we don't specify a port number to listen on, which causes the operating system to assign 
    a free one. We need this advanced code to find out which number has been assigned. </p>

   <p>The new code is just the pasted in declaration code from <b>poe_tcp.pl</b>. Save and run that

   <p>In Terminal1, you can do <i>both</i> kinds of input like before:</p>
   
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE TERMINAL SESSION: Commands to type</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~/perl4(2)$ <span class="purple">echo "Hello World" &gt;&gt; testfile</span>

   <p>The command sequence to exit telnet (because we never gave our server any conditions under which to 
    drop the connection itself) is <b>Ctrl+]</b> to get the telnet prompt, then <b>quit</b> to exit.</p>
    
   <p>You can see here that the POE program was able to listen for <i>both</i> kinds of event simultaneously, 
    and respond to each one as it occurred. Each session did the combined work of the 
    the previous two individual programs. POE programs are capable of registering for and 
    responding to arbitrary numbers of event types and events. See how POE is more like an operating 
    system than a program?</p>

  <p>If you aren't ready to create your own POE programs just yet, that's entirely understandable. This
