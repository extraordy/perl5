 <p>Most people receive excessive amounts of email. We're going to learn how to send them even more, 
  but the email we'll send can make their lives easier. For instance, an email message that lets someone know that their 
  bank balance has just dipped into the negative could be really useful.</p>
 
 <p>Note that one of the more common use cases for sending email may not require that you know anything about 
  sending email. If you want a Unix <b>cron</b> job running under your username to send you email, then it 
  already will: anything written to standard output by a cron job is emailed to the user it is running as. 
  All you need is a ~/.forward file to send it to your server and you're set.</p>
  
 <p>This lesson includes these topics:</p>

 <a name="h_01"></a><div class="heading">Sending Plain Email</div><div class="headingText">
  
  <p>Even if you enjoy email replete 
   with multimedia and attractive embedded images, there are many people who 
   detest receiving such mail and automatically delete anything that isn't plain text. From a programming perspective, plain text can 
   be extracted, parsed, and searched much more easily. Since plain text is the most basic kind of email, 
   we'll start there.</p>
  
  <p>Let's explore the structure of an email message. It has a lot in common with HTTP. 
   An email message consists of a <i>header</i>, a blank line, and a <i>body</i>. The header 
   consists of lines that start with a tag, a colon, and a value (or lines that continue the value of a 
   previous line—confusingly perhaps, these lines are also called, "headers.") When you see an email 
   message in a mail reading client, it is typically displayed with a separate header (though usually not every 
   header line is displayed, because there may be lots of them, including those that describe the path the message has taken to get there). 
   The headers "From" 
   and "To" are usually present, though instead of—"To," you can use "Cc" 
   (Carbon copy) or "Bcc" (Blind carbon copy). </p>
  
  <p>A basic email transaction consists of the sending party making a connection over TCP port 25 
   to a mail exchanging host, sending a few SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) commands that indicate who the message is from, who it is 
   for, and the content of the message itself.</p>
  
  <p>You may notice some redundancy there. The email message and the SMTP command both identify the recipient. 
   This apparent redundancy is necessary though because the email message may be addressed to multiple 
   recipients, each reached using different mail exchanging hosts; each of those hosts will be the target of a separate SMTP 
   transaction. But still, even though the SMTP recipient ought to be the same as the email message recipient, it isn't required. 
   (And unfortunately, this feature often enables spam.)</p>
    
  <a name="s_01"></a><div id="s_01"><div class="subheading">sendmail</div><div class="subheadingText">
   
   <p>I'll illustrate mail sending with a program found on nearly every Unix host: 
    <b>sendmail</b>. This incredibly complex program accepts a mail message, figures out the correct mail exchanging 
    host(s) to connect to, sends the SMTP commands to them, and if it can't reach them, automatically queues 
    and retries the messages until it succeeds or is forced to give up and return the message to the sender, 
    marked as undeliverable. To take advantage of all of those features, we just pass an email 
    message to sendmail's standard input. Let's do that now! Create a new file called <b>/perl4/sendmail.pl</b> in the CodeRunner editor:</p>
         
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE:</div><div class="listing"><pre>#!/usr/local/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

print "Enter your email address: ";
chomp( my $to = &lt;STDIN&gt; );

chomp( my $from = "$ENV{USER}\@" . `hostname` );
my $msg = join '', &lt;DATA&gt;;
$msg = eval qq{"$msg"};

open my $fh, "|-", "sendmail -t" or die "Can't pipe to sendmail: $!\n";

print {$fh} $msg;

Hello, $ENV{USER}!  Congratulations on making it this far through
the course!  There's more to come!

Sincerely,

The Management.

   <p>There is no error checking, so make sure you enter your email address correctly. 
    Now, go and check in your email client to see if you've received a 
    message. (If you haven't, check your spam folder and whitelist <i>your_username</i>@cold1.useractive.com.)</p>
     
   <p>One technique illustrated in this program is the <i>double string eval,</i> a quick-and-dirty (very 
    quick and very dirty) method of including variables in a string. We could have achieved the same effect 
    with a double-quoted heredoc, but I wanted to place the message at the end of the program in a data 
    block.</p>
     
   <p>As straightforward as this approach is, it's fraught with risk. Any mistake in the format of the email message 
    and our message might disappear without notification or be redirected to the wrong address. Fortunately, there are 
    modules to help with that.</p>

   <p>Email::Sender will allow us to send the basic messages we're working on now, as well as the more complex messages we'll devise later. 
    Create a new file named <b>sender.pl</b> as shown below:</p>

use strict;

print "Enter your email address: ";
chomp( my $to = &lt;STDIN&gt; );
my $user  = $ENV{USER};
my $gecos = (getpwnam $user)[6];
my $from  = "$user\@" . hostname();
my $email = Email::Simple-&gt;create(

        To      =&gt; qq{"$gecos" &lt;$to&gt;},
        From    =&gt; qq{"$gecos" &lt;$from&gt;},
        Subject =&gt; "Welcome to the next level",
    ],
    body =&gt; "Congratulations, you're now sending mail with Perl modules!\n",
  );

   <p>We're using the <b>send</b> method of the <b>Email::Sender</b> module, which takes as argument an 
    <b>Email::Simple</b> object representing an email message. We load in the <b>Email::Simple::Creator</b> module to 
    help us create that message, which has a header (an <b>arrayref</b>) and a body as shown.</p>
  
   <p>This time, we used the <b>Sys::Hostname</b> module, a more portable and reliable method to get our 
    hostname. (Not that there's anything
   particularly useful about using the <b>from</b> address that we have,
   but it involves the least amount of lying.) <b>getpwnam</b> is a Perl <i>builtin</i>, and we use it to fetch the 
    full version of your name from the /etc/passwd file on this machine. The (quirky) name for this field is 
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gecos_field" target="_blank">GECOS</a>.</p>

  <p>Of course, sometimes you'll want to send email that contains attachments, or HTML formatting, or both, so let's give that a try. 
   We'll need an attachment to send, so fetch this one into your current directory:</p>
   
  <div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE TERMINAL SESSION: Command to type</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~/perl4$ <ins>wget http://perl4.oreillyschool.com/ost-mirror/images/illinois.jpg</ins>

  <a name="s_01"></a><div id="s_01"><div class="subheading">Email::Stuff</div><div class="subheadingText">
   
   <p>Sending HTML email used to be a longer, more complicated process to learn until Ricardo Signes wrote <b>Email::Stuff</b>. 
    We'll use it now and see just how streamlined the process has become. Create a new file as shown:</p>
   
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO ENTER:</div><div class="listing"><pre>#!/usr/local/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

use lib "$ENV{HOME}/mylib/lib/perl5";
use Email::Stuff;
use LWP::Simple;
use HTML::TreeBuilder;
use Sys::Hostname;

print "Enter your email address: ";
chomp( my $to = &lt;STDIN&gt; );
my $from    = "$ENV{USER}\@" . hostname();
my $subject = 'Multimedia email test from Perl 4 course';
my $text    = &lt;&lt;"EOT";
This is the text part of the message.  Your mail reader may not
even show it to you until you explicitly request it.
EOT

my $url = 'http://perl4.oreillyschool.com/ost-mirror/courses/index.html';
my $tree = HTML::TreeBuilder-&gt;new;
$tree-&gt;parse( get( $url ) );

my $target_element = $tree-&gt;look_down( _tag =&gt; 'div', class =&gt; 'right-content' );

my $html = $target_element-&gt;as_HTML;

Email::Stuff-&gt;to( $to )
            -&gt;from( $from )
            -&gt;subject( $subject )
            -&gt;text_body( $text )
            -&gt;html_body( $html )
            -&gt;attach_file( 'illinois.jpg' )
            -&gt;send;</pre></div></div>
      
   <p>Save it as <b>/perl4/send_fancy.pl</b> and run it. Now check your email client. (We saved 
    ourselves the trouble of writing lots of fancy HTML by borrowing a bit from a page someone else wrote.)</p>
      
   <p>This ilustrates another Perl object-oriented idiom: <i>method chaining</i>. Each of the methods you see 
    called at the end (with the exception of <b>send</b>) returns the object upon which an operation is being performed. You 
    could write your own versions of these with something like this:</p>
      
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE:</div><div class="observe"><pre>
sub to
{
  my ($what, @args) = @_;

  unless ( ref $what )
  {
    $what = $what-&gt;new;
  }
  $what-&gt;set_to( @args );
  return $what;
}</pre></div></div>
      
   <p>The <b>subject</b> method, for instance, would be the same, only <b>to</b> would be replaced by 
    <b>subject</b>. (Of course, you wouldn't repeat them; you'd use method generation to avoid duplication.) 
    The <b>set_to</b> method is defined elsewhere to do whatever is required to parse the arguments and set 
    the appropriate attribute of the object. </p>
      
   <p>All of these methods can be called in any order. They can be called multiple times (if you have, say, 
    multiple attachments, or multiple recipients). There are other possibilities not shown here (see 
    <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Email::Stuff" target="_blank">http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Email::Stuff</a>). And you don't need to use all the ones we used in this example, either.</p>

  <a name="s_02"></a><div id="s_02"><div class="subheading">Caveats</div><div class="subheadingText">
   
   <p>When sending email for the first time from a particular machine, you could encounter random problems that may 
    have little to do with Perl. Errors may not be readily visible or located in inaccessible places that only root can read, such as a 
    /var/log/maillog file. </p>
   
   <p>Some errors are due to sendmail being inaccessible. For instance, I discovered that
    sendmail is misconfigured on the machine where I developed this material before testing it on 
    the student machine; all my messages got saved to a dead.letter file. (Solving this problem required 
    delving into sendmail configuration files, a topic way outside the scope of this course.)</p>
     
   <p>But before you call out for a system administrator to help, there are a few possible solutions to errors you can try. The modules 
     we use can send mail without using <b>sendmail</b>. For instance, they can make direct SMTP connections 
    if you have the address of a host that will relay mail for you. Generally, such a host is provided
    by your ISP. In <b>send_fancy.pl</b>, you would call <b>using</b> to help: </p>
     
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: Code fragment</div><div class="observe"><pre>...-&gt;subject( $subject )
-&gt;using( SMTP =&gt; $mail_relay_host )
-&gt;text_body...</pre></div></div>
     
   <p>In the <b>Email::Sender</b> program, you would create a <i>transport</i> object to replace the default 
    sendmail transport object, and pass it in the <b>send</b> call: </p>
     
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: Code fragment</div><div class="observe"><pre>...
use Email::Sender::Transport;
my $transport = Email::Sender::Transport::SMTP-&gt;new({
    host =&gt; $mail_relay_host,
    port =&gt; $mail_relay_port,  # Only include this line if $mail_relay_host uses a port other than 25
});

Email::Sender::Simple-&gt;send( $email, { transport =&gt; $transport } );</pre></div></div>
  </div></div>
   
  <p>As with all of the applied topics we discuss, learning the details of the underlying protocol 
   will pay off with time saved. Knowing how email gets sent—the basic functionality of SMTP, 
   the envelope, header, body structure of messages, how mail relays work—can save you lots of time troubleshooting in 
   situations where the basic approaches don't work.</p>
