 <p>Welcome back!  A couple of lessons ago we learned to create object classes and 
  accessor methods. Accessor methods looked so similar that we came up with some pretty hairy 
  ways of automating the process? You may have felt that that process was inefficient. You are not alone. In 
  this lesson, we'll learn about Moose, the most-frequently preferred object-oriented helper framework for the 
  modern Perl programmer.</p>

  <p><div class="c">"I write less code thanks to Moose, I write better code thanks to Moose. Basically I am a happier 
   person all around because Moose takes much of the drudge work out of my day."<br>
   -Ben Hengst</div></p>
  
  <p>Moose allows you to focus more on your solution and less on erecting "scaffolding" 
   (lengthy pieces of code for performing basic operations) when 
   you create your own object classes. Moose lets you 
   leave out much of that scaffolding.</p>
    
  <p>Behind the scenes, objects are being created as hash references, and 
   methods are still subroutines in classes that are packages, but Moose gives you a nicer syntax with much 
   less code duplication. Moose is also 
   <i>extensible</i>; there is a variety of modules available that extend the functionality of Moose. 
   For instance, if you want your objects to be opaque to your users, you can use a Moose extension for 
   inside-out objects.</p>
   
  <p>Moose doesn't come with the core Perl distribution (at least not yet) so we have to install it. You do it like this:</p>

<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~$ <ins>cd perl4</ins>
cold:~/perl4$ <ins>PERL5LIB=~/mylib/lib/perl5 cpan Moose</ins></pre></div></div>
   
  <p>Sit back and observe while a whole slew of modules is downloaded and installed for you (this big event is one of the 
   reasons it's not part of the Perl core yet). You may be asked whether or not you want to install particular items 
   permanently. You can answer <b>yes</b> or <b>no</b> to continue. When it finishes, verify the installation like this:</p>
   
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~$ <ins>perl -I ~/mylib/lib/perl5 -MMoose -le 'print $Moose::VERSION'</ins>
2.0001 <i># Or something higher as Moose gets updated</i>
</pre></div></div>
   
  <p>You can access the local documentation via <b>PERL5LIB=~/mylib/lib/perl5 perldoc Moose</b>, but there is so
    much documentation that it's easy to get lost and not know where to begin; even the Moose introduction 
    manual has fifteen sections! This lesson will give you the starting point.</p>

  <p>Let's write our first class using Moose! Right-click your <b>/perl4</b> folder and select 
   <b>New folder...</b> to create a <b>/Music</b> subfolder. Then, create this file in the CodeRunner editor:</p>
     
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO ENTER:</div><div class="listing"><pre>package Music::Song;

use lib qw(<i>your_home_directory</i>/mylib/lib/perl5);
      
use Moose;

has artist =&gt; ( isa =&gt; 'Str', is =&gt; 'rw' );
has title  =&gt; ( isa =&gt; 'Str', is =&gt; 'rw' );
has length =&gt; ( isa =&gt; 'Num', is =&gt; 'rw' );
has id     =&gt; ( isa =&gt; 'Int', is =&gt; 'ro' );

1;
</pre></div></div>
  
  <p>Replace <i>your_home_directory</i> with the appropriate path; for this site, it would be 
   "/users/" plus your O'Reilly School login—for example, <b>/users/pscott</b>.</p>
  
  <p><img src="images/coderunner/save.gif"> Save it in your <b>/perl4/Music</b> folder as <b>Song.pm</b>.</p>
     
  <p>And there it is—a complete class! It doesn't have <i>behavior</i>, of course—Moose is not 
   psychic—but it does have a surprising amount of <i>accessor functionality</i>, as we'll see in a 
   moment. You don't even need to <b>use strict</b> and <b>use warnings</b> because Moose does them for you (you do 
   still need to use those pragmas in programs that use Moose-ified modules though). Let's see what this class 
   can do with a quick program. Create a new Perl program in the CodeRunner editor:</p>
     
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO ENTER:</div><div class="listing"><pre>#!/usr/local/bin/perl

use Music::Song;

my $pop = Music::Song-&gt;new( id     =&gt; 12345,
                            artist =&gt; 'Rick Dees',
                            title  =&gt; 'Disco Duck',
                          );
$pop-&gt;length( 3*60 + 17 );
print $pop-&gt;title, ' by ', $pop-&gt;artist, ' is ', $pop-&gt;length, " seconds long\n";
$pop-&gt;id( 54321 );
</pre></div></div>
     
  <p><img src="images/coderunner/save.gif"> Save it in your <b>/perl4</b> folder as <b>use_song.pl</b> and run 
   it:</p>

<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~/perl4$ <ins>./use_song.pl</ins>

</pre></div></div>    
     
  <p>Notice that not only has Moose provided accessor methods for everything we defined with the <b>has</b> 
   keyword, but it also allowed us to specify that one of them was <i>read-only,</i> that is, it could only
   be set during object construction and not changed later.</p>
     
  <p>In addition, Moose allows us to specify <i>types</i> for our attributes. Now let's see what happens when we pass a value 
   of the wrong type for an attribute. Change the value of <b>id</b> from an integer to a string in 
   <b>use_song.pl</b> as shown:</p>

  <p>At this point it would be natural to think, "If <b>Music::Song</b> has a length attribute and a <b>length_pretty</b>
   method, and <b>Music::CD</b> has a length attribute, then <b>Music::CD</b> ought to have a <b>length_pretty</b> method too." 
   What does the lazy (remember, we like lazy) programmer do?  Copy and paste the <b>length_pretty</b> method 
   from <b>Music/Song.pm</b> to <b>Music/CD.pm</b>? No! Many people <i>would</i> do that, but that's <i>false laziness</i>. 
   Why? Because while it might be fast to copy-and-paste, it'll cost <i>far</i> more time later. If 
   we ever want to modify that routine, not only would we have to copy-and-paste in two places, but we'd 
   have to <i>remember</i> where to do it, because there's no tool in place to remind us. </p>
     
  <p>The real problem with the copy-and-paste approach is that it makes a two copies of a piece of code where only one copy should 
    be. But how do we solve this? One possible answer would be to use <i>inheritance</i>. So what exactly should the inheritance tree for this look like? Do 
   <b>Music::Song</b> and <b>Music::CD</b> both inherit the <b>length_pretty</b> method from some other class and if so, what 
   should that class be called? <b>Music::Util</b>? <b>Music::Stringify</b>? <b>Music::LengthPretty</b>? This is one of the 
   situations where inheritance is an unsatisfactory solution. Fortunately, Moose has 
   a better answer: <i>roles</i>. </p>
     
  <p>A role is not a class. A role is a set of attributes and/or methods that you can add to a class. The class 
   then acts as though those attributes and methods had been defined there all along. Let's see how to use a 
   role to solve this problem! First, create <b>StringFuncs.pm</b> in the <b>Music</b> folder, then put the 
    <b>length_pretty method</b> in it as shown:</p>
     
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO ENTER:</div><div class="listing"><pre>package StringFuncs;
      
use Moose::Role;

my $ONE_MINUTE = 60;  # seconds

sub length_pretty
{
  my $self = shift;
  my $seconds = $self-&gt;length;
  my $minutes = int( $seconds / $ONE_MINUTE );
  return sprintf q{%d' %d"}, $minutes, $seconds % $ONE_MINUTE;
}</pre></div></div>
     
  <p>This may <i>look</i> like a class, but it isn't one (so doesn't need to end with a 1;). It 
   can't be use-d. It uses <b>Moose::Role</b>, not <b>Moose</b>. We'll see how it gets used now by modifying 
   <b>Music/Song.pm</b> to say that it uses the StringFuncs role:</p>
     
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO EDIT:</div><div class="listing"><pre>package Music::Song;

use Moose;

has artist =&gt; ( isa =&gt; 'Str', is =&gt; 'rw', required =&gt; 1 );
has title  =&gt; ( isa =&gt; 'Str', is =&gt; 'rw', required =&gt; 1 );
has length =&gt; ( isa =&gt; 'Num', is =&gt; 'rw', required =&gt; 1 );
has id     =&gt; ( isa =&gt; 'Int', is =&gt; 'ro' );

<del>my $ONE_MINUTE = 60;  # seconds
</del><ins>with 'StringFuncs';
</ins><del>sub length_pretty
{
  my $self = shift;
  my $seconds = $self-&gt;length;
  my $minutes = int( $seconds / $ONE_MINUTE );
  return sprintf q{%d' %d"}, $minutes, $seconds % $ONE_MINUTE;
}
</del>
1;</pre></div></div>
     
  <p>The <b>with</b> statement tells us that we should use the roles in the named module. Now modify 
   <b>Music/CD.pm</b> like this:</p>
     
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO EDIT:</div><div class="listing"><pre>package Music::CD;

use Moose;

has songs =&gt; ( isa =&gt; 'ArrayRef[Music::Song]', is =&gt; 'rw' );
has title =&gt; ( isa =&gt; 'Str', is =&gt; 'rw' );
has id    =&gt; ( isa =&gt; 'Int', is =&gt; 'ro' );

<ins>with 'StringFuncs';</ins>
 
sub length
{
  my $self = shift;

  my $total = 0;
  for my $song ( @{ $self-&gt;songs } )
  {
    $total += $song-&gt;length;
  }

  return $total;
}

1;</pre></div></div>
     
  <p>And now let's modify <b>use_cd.pl</b>:</p>
  
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO EDIT:</div><div class="listing"><pre>#!/usr/local/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

use lib qw(<i>your_home_directory</i>/mylib/lib/perl5);
use Music::CD;
use Music::Song;

my $pop = Music::Song-&gt;new( id     =&gt; 12345,
                            artist =&gt; 'Rick Dees',
                            title  =&gt; 'Disco Duck',
                            length =&gt; 3*60 + 17,
                          );
my $scrump = Music::Song-&gt;new( id     =&gt; 54321,
                               artist =&gt; 'The Wurzels',
                               title  =&gt; 'Combine Harvester',
                               length =&gt; 3*60 + 5,
                             );
my $cd = Music::CD-&gt;new( title =&gt; 'Worst Hits of the Seventies',
                         songs =&gt; [ $pop, $scrump ]);
print 'Total length of songs on "', $cd-&gt;title, '" is ', $cd-&gt;<del>length</del><ins>length_pretty</ins>, "<del> seconds</del>\n";</pre></div></div>
     
  <p><img src="images/coderunner/save.gif"> Save and run it:</p>
     
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~/perl4$ <ins>./use_cd.pl</ins>
Total length of songs on "Worst Hits of the Seventies" is 6' 22"</pre></div></div>
     
  <p>And now run <b>use_song.pl</b>; it still produces the same result as it did before:</p>
  
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~/perl4$ <ins>./use_song.pl</ins>
Disco Duck by Rick Dees is 3' 17" in length</pre></div></div>
     
  <p>I've snuck something by you in the <b>length_pretty</b> method:</p>
     
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: Code fragment</div><div class="observe"><pre>  my $seconds = $self-&gt;<span class="darkgreen">length</span>;</pre></div></div>
     
  <p>Which <span class="darkgreen">length</span> method is being called there? It's the 
   Music::Song length attribute in the case of use_song.pl and the Music::CD length method in the case of 
   use_cd.pl. It makes no difference that one is an attribute and one is a method, because Perl uses the same syntax to 
   access both. This is polymorphism at its finest! (More strictly-typed object-oriented
   languages make this sort of thing very difficult.)</p>
     
  <p>Now, it was pretty convenient that the length attribute method had the same name and definition in both 
   classes (and you may be assured, that was not an accident on my part). But it would be better if we captured that 
   dependency in our code somehow, so that if anyone ever changes the name of the length method, we'll know 
   about it. Moose gives us a way to do that. Go ahead and modify StringFuncs.pm as shown:</p>
     
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO EDIT:</div><div class="listing"><pre>package StringFuncs;

use Moose::Role;

<ins>requires 'length';</ins>
 
my $ONE_MINUTE = 60;  # seconds

sub length_pretty
{
  my $self = shift;
  my $seconds = $self-&gt;length;
  my $minutes = int( $seconds / $ONE_MINUTE );
  return sprintf q{%d' %d"}, $minutes, $seconds % $ONE_MINUTE;
}</pre></div></div>
     
  <p>This tells Moose that the StringFuncs role can only be used by classes that provide the method named by 
   <b>requires</b> (note that this is <b>requires</b>, not to be confused with <b>require</b>).</p>
     
 
     
  <p><table class="noteBox fBox pBox "><tr><td class="noteTitle">Note</td><td class="note"> You may have wondered why we don't just set the environment variable PERL5LIB and do away with 
   the <b>use lib</b> statement in our programs. (Many programmers have taken that shortcut and suffered the 
   consequences.) But those programs would then depend upon something being set in the environment that was not 
   guaranteed and instead get set somewhere else, possibly by a 
   different person. If the programs are run under a different shell—such as a <i>cron</i> job—or 
   by a different user, they will break. Then someone would have to figure out the problem, someone who probably doesn't know 
   how the working versions of the programs are being run. The same issues arise 
   for programs that have been compiled to require the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH to be set.</td></tr></table></p>
 
   <p>So that does it for our introduction to Moose.  Now you have a good foundation for understanding how to create your very 
   own object-oriented modules! Well done.</p>
