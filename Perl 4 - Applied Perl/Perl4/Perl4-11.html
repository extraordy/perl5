 <a href="Perl4-11.html" name="url_manipulation"></a>
 <a name="h_01"></a><div class="heading">URL Manipulation</div><div class="headingText">
  
  <p>Let's start by going over URLs (Uniform Resource Locators) like this one: 
   http://www.oreillyschool.com/contact.php. The basic structure of a URL is:</p>
  
  <div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: URL Structure</div><div class="observe"><pre>
   <span class="darkred">protocol</span>://<span class="darkblue">server</span>/<span class="darkred">request</span>
   <span class="darkgreen">http</span>://<span class="darkblue">www.oreillyschool.com</span>/<span class="darkred">contact.php</span></pre></div></div>
  
  <p>So, should the client use HTTP commands over port 80, or FTP commands over port 21? 
   The <span class="darkgreen">protocol</span> (or <i>scheme</i>) tells a client which method to use to talk 
   to the <span class="darkblue">server</span>. 
   Each protocol has a default port number associated with it that can be overridden by embedding an alternative at the end of the 
   server after a colon; for example:</p>
  
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE:</div><div class="observe"><pre><span class="darkgreen">http</span>://<span class="darkblue">www.oreillyschool.com:8080</span>/<span class="darkred">contact.php</span></pre></div></div>
  
  <p>The <span class="darkred">request</span> gets sent to the server. <i>Clients</i> may break this 
   up when using protocols other than HTTP, but when using HTTP, that request is sent to the server exactly as it is. 
   You may think that because the request looks like, say, <b>/stocks/query.cgi?ticker=ORYL</b>, that it has to 
   call a program and pass a parameter to it, but in fact, the server can do anything 
   it wants with that request. It may just serve back an image. A request like <b>/help.html</b> might 
   look like it's going to return an HTML page, but instead the server might run a program that creates and 
   returns a PDF document. The server is free to choose, but most servers are configured to take specific actions in response to 
   requests. The server presumes that there is a certain structure to requests; we'll go over how to 
   interpret that structure.</p>

   <p>While you might be tempted to parse URLs with a regular expression, we have a better module 
    already installed for this: <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/URI/URI.pm" target="_blank">URI</a>, 
    which stands for Uniform Resource Identifier. Let's create a URL-parsing program using URI. Type the 
    code below as shown:</p>

while ( &lt;DATA&gt; )
{
  chomp( my $url = $_ );
  print "Analyzing $url:\n";
  my $uri = URI-&gt;new( $url );
  for my $method (qw( scheme host port userinfo path query  ) )
  {
    printf "%10s\t", $method;
    print defined($uri-&gt;$method)? $uri-&gt;$method : '&lt;unset&gt;', "\n";
  }

   <p>There are many other methods available, but these are the most useful for parsing URLs. If you're 
    using code that parses a web page and pulls a URL out of it as a URI.pm object, there is one more method 
    that you'll want to know about: <b>abs</b>. Let's create another program that uses the <b>abs</b> method:</p>
   
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO ENTER:</div><div class="listing"><pre>#!/usr/local/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

use lib "$ENV{HOME}/mylib/lib/perl5";

my $page          = 'http://www.oreillyschool.com/courses/perl4/faq.html';
my $url_relative  = '../images/camel.png';

my $uri = URI-&gt;new( $url_relative );
print $uri-&gt;abs( $page ), "\n";

   <p>Imagine that a program pulled down the content for the page at 
    <b>http://www.oreillyschool.com/courses/perl4/faq.html</b> and encountered within it, an IMG tag using the relative 
       URL ../images/camel.png. <b>URI.pm</b> allows you to figure out its corresponding absolute URL, 
    the URL that a browser would load when looking at that <b>faq.html</b> page.</p>

 <a href="Perl4-11.html" name="parsing_html"></a>
 <a name="h_02"></a><div class="heading">Parsing HTML</div><div class="headingText">
   
  <p>In general, regular expressions are usually inadequate for parsing HTML, because of the possibility of nesting and comments; just try 
   writing code to extract text from this:</p>
   
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: HTML fragment</div><div class="observe"><pre>&lt;P&gt;Come &lt;I&gt;here&amp;#33;&lt;/I&gt; Mr. Watson, &lt;!-- Really need an entity for

instead? --&gt; &lt;A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Graham_Bell"&gt;I&lt;/A&gt; need you.
</pre></div></div>
   
  <p>There's a great possiblity of syntax variation even in well-formed HTML (let alone broken HTML that browsers often render anyway). 
   If you're writing code to extract text from a web page 
  that you or a trusted colleague maintains, and you're certain that the format won't 
   change—then you can go ahead and use regular expressions. You were able 
   to do the assignment in the last lesson because I made sure that the string you were looking for was the 
   only thing inside any tag.</p>
   
  <p>There are modules designed to do the heavy lifting of HTML parsing for you; we'll look at those 
   now. First, install the modules you'll need for this lesson. Type the command below as shown:</p>

   <p>While the increasing popularity of cascading style sheets has made the &lt;DIV&gt; tag increasingly common, 
       tables are still the prevalent method for presenting tabular information; let's see how to 
    parse them. We'll use the HTML::TableParser module in an example. Once again, I've mirrored an 
    external page to the student machine so you can fetch it. You can bring up

    for O'Reilly's Open Source Conference in Portland, Oregon, in 2006. Your course author gave a presentation at that conference; let's 
    write a program to find out exactly where. Create a new file in the CodeRunner editor as shown:</p>

my %opts = ( DecodeNBSP =&gt; 1, Trim =&gt; 1, Chomp =&gt; 1, MultiMatch =&gt; 1 );
my $tp = HTML::TableParser-&gt;new( \@reqs, \%opts );
$tp-&gt;parse( $mech-&gt;content );

my @Rooms;

  my ( undef, undef, $cols ) = @_;

  # @$cols contains room names right before we get to session content
  @Rooms = @$cols;
}


sub row
{
  my ( undef, undef, $cols ) = @_;
  for my $index ( 0 .. $#$cols )
  {
    next unless $cols-&gt;[$index] =~ /Peter Scott/;
    print "Found course author at $cols-&gt;[0] in $Rooms[$index]\n";
  }
}

   <p><img src="images/coderunner/save.gif"> Save it as <b>/perl4/table_parse.pl</b> and run it. You'll 
    see my name, Peter Scott, appearing in two sessions, along with times, dates, and room numbers. How 
    did we do this?</p>

{
  my ( undef, undef, $cols ) = @_;
  for my $index ( 0 .. $#$cols )
  {
    next unless $cols-&gt;[$index] =~ /Peter Scott/;
    print "Found course author at $cols-&gt;[0] in $Rooms[$index]\n";
  }
}
</pre></div></div>   
   
   <p>First, we fetched the page with WWW::Mechanize (<span class="darkblue">$mech-&gt;get( $URL )</span>). Then, we set 
    up these <span class="darkgreen">requirements</span> for HTML::TableParser: look for a table with a header column 
    containing "Portland." That requirement matches the five tables that contain schedule data; the sixth wraps all of them
    together to form the page and does not have a header containing "Portland." HTML::TableParser would 
    ordinarily stop when it found the first table matching this requirement, but we want all of them, so we specify 
    <span class="darkred">MultiMatch</span>. And because the data contains many <b>&amp;nbsp;</b> entities that would 
    otherwise be turned into characters that don't actually match <b>\s</b>, we specify 
    <span class="purple">DecodeNBSP</span>. </p>
   
   <p>We tell the parser that whenever it encounters a <span class="green">row</span>, it should call the <span class="green">row</span> 
    callback, and whenever it encounters a <span class="orange">header row</span>, it should call the <span class="orange">hdr</span> 
    callback. Each of those is called with the same data; we're not interested in the first two arguments so we 
    assign them to undef.</p>
   
   <p>Then we call the <span class="blue">parse</span> method, passing the page content as the HTML to be parsed. This causes 
    the parser to go through all of the tags on the page, picking the data apart as it goes, and whenever it 
    encounters a closing <b>&lt;/TR&gt;</b> tag, it will call <span class="orange">hdr</span> (if it finds a 
    <b>&lt;TH&gt;</b> tag in the row) or else it calls <span class="green">row</span>.</p>
   
   <p>Our strategy for finding the room is to save the last header row we see, which contains that information. 
    (HTML::TableParser merges in the data from the previous header row that spanned across all 
    columns.) We save that, and then when we find a match for the text we want; the column index 
    we find it in is also the index of the room description in @Rooms.</p>
   
   <p>One final note: The <span class="blue">parse</span> method actually does not come from HTML::TableParser; it comes
    from a more basic module, HTML::Parser, which derived classes like HTML::TableParser are able to use to  
    find all the individual tags (tokens delimited by angle brackets, for the most part) in HTML.</p>

   <p>An HTML page can be seen not just as a string of characters, but also as a hierarchical structure defined
    by the scope of the tags, or elements, within it. Its tree-like structure looks like this:</p>
     
   
   <p><div class="c"><img src="http://oreilly.com/catalog/jscript4/chapter/js4_1701.gif"></div></p>
     
   <p>The HTML::TreeBuilder module turns an HTML page into a data structure like that, where each node in the
    tree is a member of the HTML::Element class. Let's check out at an example.</p>

   <p>The program has extracted the courses that are links after bullet points. How?</p>
     
   <p>The HTML::TreeBuilder object is clever: it inherits not just from HTML::Parser, but also from 
    HTML::Element. So once you have called the <b>parse</b> method from HTML::Parser, the $tree object becomes 
    the root element of the tree it just built from the HTML document. Before you go further, take a look at the 
    documentation for the <b>tag</b> and the <b>look_down</b> and <b>look_up</b> methods of HTML::Element at 
    <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?HTML::Element" target="_blank">http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?HTML::Element</a> before you go on.</p>

    that also meet the criteria of the <span class="darkred">in_list</span> callback (which must return true). The 
    <span class="darkgreen">look_down</span> method scans every element, testing to see if it meets these two 
    criteria. We have decided (after inspecting the HTML) that we want the text from certain links. The 
    <span class="darkred">in_list</span> callback decides which links: First, the link must be contained within a 
    <b>&lt;LI&gt;</b> tag. Second, it must <i>not</i> have any ancestors that are <b>&lt;DIV&gt;</b> 
    tags meeting the criteria of the <b>in_nav</b> callback: either the <b>class</b> or <b>id</b> attribute 
    of the <b>&lt;DIV&gt;</b> tag contains the string <b>nav</b>. Checking out the HTML source code will help make this logic more clear.</p>

   <p>HTML::TreeParser and HTML::Element provide elegant ways to interpret HTML, but you've seen
