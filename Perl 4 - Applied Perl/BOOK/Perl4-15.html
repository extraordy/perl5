 <p>You've made it! You've arrived at the final lesson of <i>Applied Perl</i>. It's clear 
  that Perl is a rich field that we could keep using to generate content more or less indefinitely (in fact 
  your author salivates over the thought of the possible royalties!), but at some point, 
  we have to decide when you have had enough. We have reached that point. If there are to be more Perl courses, 
  they will come about as a result of feedback from you. But for now, we'll wind up our course with the intention of empowering you 
  to advance your Perl education through your own resources.</p>

   <p>There is a saying that goes, "Real programmers don't document; it was hard to write, it should be hard 
    to understand." I don't know who wrote that, but I disagree! 
    Even if for no other audience than yourself, documentation is important. Look at how 
    much of it you have read and relied upon throughout this course. When you write code, 
    remember the standard set by those authors who helped you with notes and documentation, and follow their example.</p>
    
   <p>Fortunately, Perl makes it as convenient as possible to create documentation. Let's ask and answer a few questions about it now:</p> 
   
   <p><b>Q:</b> Where is the easiest place to document a program or module?<br> 
    <b>A:</b> In the file where the code is located.</p> 
   <p><b>Q:</b> What's the best way to make it attractive to write documentation?<br> 
    <b>A:</b> Allow it to be inserted wherever you are in the source.</p> 
   <p><b>Q:</b> What's the easiest format to use?<br> 
    <b>A:</b> The same ASCII (or UTF-8) text you're using to create the code.</p>
   <p><b>Q:</b> What's the easiest tool to use?<br> 
    <b>A:</b> The same editor you're using to write the code.</p> 
   <p><b>Q:</b> What's the easiest way to ensure that documentation can be rendered into different formats 
    depending on the presentation tool?<br> 
    <b>A:</b> Use a markup language.</p>
    
   <p>Perl's <b>POD</b>—Plain Old Documentation—satisfies all of those constraints. It's a markup 
    language—yes, it uses angle brackets, but it's <i>not</i> an XML application, and the main 
    directives are lines starting with an equals sign. Larry Wall designed it to be as easy 
    to use and understand as possible. All the documentation you've 
    read, from pages like <b>perlop</b>, to <b>perldoc -f crypt</b>, to module documentation, was written in 
    POD. Most of the POD for modules was embedded in the .pm file with the source code; when you run 
    <b>perldoc</b>, it looks in @INC (with a few subdirectories) for file names ending in .pod or .pm.</p>
    
   <p>Let's use POD to document a program. Edit the last version of <b>parsedate.pl</b> from the previous 
    lesson:</p>

   <p>The first line of  POD begins with an equals sign (no leading white space), and continues until 
    a line starting with the directive <b>=cut</b>. The documentation for POD is found at 
    <b>perldoc perlpod</b> and is—you guessed it—written in POD. POD can be rendered into many 
    formats. When you run <b>perldoc</b>, POD gets formatted like a Unix manual page. When you look at, say, 
    <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?perlpod" target="_blank">http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?perlpod</a>, the <i>same POD source</i> is run through a 
    POD-to-HTML formatter. (For the sake of efficiency, the HTML got cached when the POD was last changed. 
    The point I'm making here is that no one is spending time writing HTML versions of the documentation.) Most of the 
    O'Reilly books on Perl were written in POD (with some custom extensions for tables and footnotes).</p>
    
   <p>Because the POD format is so straightforward, I won't explain here. You
    can read about it in the documentation. Instead, we will move on and discuss some useful and necessary POD 
    <i>practices</i>.</p>
    
   <ul><li>POD can be placed anywhere in a program. Different people have different preferences, and rationales for 
     those preferences. You can put all the POD at the beginning of the file; the advantage there is that 
     programmers are confronted with it immediately. You can put it at the end of the file; the 
     advantage in doing that is that you can precede it with <span class="code">__END__</span> and ensure that Perl does not waste time 
     parsing it when the code is being run through Perl rather than perldoc. Or you can intersperse it 
     throughout the file. This practice is applied only to modules where the documentation consists  
     of descriptions of methods or exported functions, in which case the documentation for each method or 
     function may precede or follow that method or function. The advantage to choosing this option is 
     that the documentation 
     is immediately adjacent to the referenced code so it's easier to chang or delete when a 
     corresponding change is made to the code. </li><li>Put a blank line before, and after, every POD directive (any line starting with 
     <b>=</b>), otherwise some POD formatters won't see the directive. This does not apply to formatting 
     codes using angle brackets.</li><li>There are some standard section names to use with <span class="code">=head1</span> directives. For a 
     comprehensive list, see:  
     <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Perl::Critic::Policy::Documentation::RequirePodSections" target="_blank">http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Perl::Critic::Policy::Documentation::RequirePodSections</a>.  
     Unless you intend to pass these default perlcritic POD checks, you do not need to include all of these 
     sections, only the ones that make sense.</li></ul>

   <p>Perl has an interactive debugger. Many programmers denounce it, but when pressed, most of them 
    have never actually used it. It uses mostly single-character commands that are fairly similar to those 
    of debuggers like <b>gdb</b>. I used it as a quick way to find out where POE was 
    storing the port number for the TCP server we created a few lessons ago. The debugger is best used in 
    conjunction with the source code in an editor window nearby (although there are also several IDEs 
    available that lay all of this out for you in a GUI); that way you can use the searching power of the 
    editor to find interesting places in the code.</p>
     
   <p>One of the best applications of the debugger is in exploring code written by someone else. It also 
    gives you the ability to change the values of variables, so you can experiment without having to edit the 
    code (which can be particularly hard if the code in question is in a module in a directory you can't modify). Let's 
    look at a debugging session similar to the one I just described, using the file <b>/perl4/poe_tcp.pl</b> 
    from an earlier lesson (ensure that your version matches the one below by making sure line 16 
    is the line starting "Started =&gt;"):</p>

   <p><b>perldoc perldebug</b> tells you how to use the debugger. When debugging programs that <b>fork</b>, the debugger 
    requires that you have the correct terminal settings and xterm spawning capability. For further information, you may want to read

  <p>For this final project we'll extend our bank account web interface, and we'll also learn a 
   broader lesson about <i>refactoring</i>. The current state of that interface is just too complicated to 
   be extended further. It is simply <i>not fun</i>. (This is a more important consideration than many people will 
   acknowledge—if you're not having fun, your productivity plummets.) The current code contains SQL 
   mixed in with executable code. To extend it to do more we'd add more SQL, which would lead to readability 
   problems that could be just as bad as embedded HTML in Perl programs.</p>
   
  <p>This presents a learning opportunity! We can experiment with a module that gives us a higher level of abstraction over a 
   database: <b>Class::DBI</b>. Go ahead and install it:</p>
   
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE TERMINAL SESSION: Command to type</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~/perl4$ <ins>PERL5LIB=~/mylib/lib/perl5 cpan Class::DBI</ins>
[output omitted]</pre></div></div>
   <p>
    We are going to remake our database with some different relationships and different
    column names that help <b>Class::DBI</b> do its job better (and actually model the problem
    better).  
    So unpack the tar file <b>/software/Perl4/Lesson15Files.tar.gz</b>, save the .tmpl
    files in your current (perl4) directory, and
    run the file make_db.mysql through the <b>mysql</b> program to create and populate that database:
   </p>
  
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE TERMINAL SESSION: Command to type</div><div class="interactive"><pre>cold:~/perl4$ <ins>mysql -h sql -p $USER &lt; make_db.mysql</ins>
Enter password: <ins>(type your password)</ins></pre></div></div>
   
  <p>Now create a module that will abstract out our common templating functionality:</p>
  
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO ENTER:</div><div class="listing"><pre>package MyTemplate;
use strict;
use warnings;

use base 'HTML::Template';

use CGI qw(header);
use File::Basename;

sub new
{
  my ($basename) = fileparse( $0, '.cgi' );
  return shift-&gt;SUPER::new( filename          =&gt; "$basename.tmpl",
                            die_on_bad_params =&gt; 0 );
}

sub html_output
{
  return header() . (shift-&gt;SUPER::output);
}


1;
</pre></div></div>
   
  <p><img src="images/coderunner/save.gif"> Save it as <b>/perl4/MyTemplate.pm</b> (or you 
   might want to create a special subfolder for these files, like /perl4/Lesson15, so you can 
   compare them to the versions from earlier lessons). 
    This gives us an object that inherits from HTML::Template. ('base' is a module
    that gives a clean access to @ISA.) It
    also automatically uses a template with the same name as the .cgi file
    being executed, with the extension '.tmpl' instead of '.cgi'. Now create a cgi file:
   </p>
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO ENTER:</div><div class="listing"><pre>#!/usr/local/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

use lib qw(<i>your_home_directory</i>/mylib/lib/perl5);
use CGI::Carp qw(fatalsToBrowser);
use MyTemplate;
use Bank;

my $template = MyTemplate-&gt;new;
my @acct_nums = map { $_-&gt;get( 'account_number' ) } Bank::Account-&gt;retrieve_all;
$template-&gt;param( account_loop =&gt; [ map { { account_number =&gt; $_ } } @acct_nums ] );

print $template-&gt;html_output;</pre></div></div>
   
  <p>Replace <i>your_home_directory</i> with your home directory in this and all other .cgi files. 
   Save it in the appropriate folder as <b>atm_select.cgi</b>. </p>
  
  <table class="noteBox "><tr><td class="noteTitle">Note</td><td class="note">So far, we have used <b>use lib "$ENV{HOME}/mylib/lib/perl5"</b> to supply the value for 
   the home directory. This pattern doesn't work with CGI, so we must instead use the form above, 
   <b>use lib qw(<i>your_home_directory</i>/mylib/lib/perl5)</b>.</td></tr></table>
  
  <p>This looks intriguing: the code 
   is essentially the same as before except that the account numbers come from a different 
   module. Let's see what that module looks like. Create another new Perl program:</p>
   
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO ENTER:</div><div class="listing"><pre>package Bank;

  <p>Insert your password where indicated, save that file as <b>Bank.pm</b>, and bring up 
    <b>http://<i>your_username</i>.oreillystudent.com/perl4/atm_select.cgi</b> in your web browser.  
    It displays the familiar menu of two account numbers. That's not bad 
    for a few lines that contain no SQL. How did they do this?</p>
   <p>
    <b>Class::DBI</b> provides an object-oriented interface to a relational database.  Each
    table is an object class, and columns within them are accessed via the <b>get</b>

__PACKAGE__-&gt;columns( All =&gt; qw(id name) );
</ins>
1;</pre></div></div>
   <p>
    You can see here that you can have multiple packages (and classes) defined
    within a single file.  That's okay as long as we don't want to put any of them
    in a <b>use</b> statement other than the one that matches the name of the file,
    "Bank."  Recall that __PACKAGE__ evaluates to the name of the current package.
    It saves us some effort and helps focus attention where it belongs.
   </p>
   <p>
    Now, create another new cgi file:
   </p>
   <div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO ENTER:</div><div class="listing"><pre>#!/usr/local/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

use lib qw(<i>your_home_directory</i>/mylib/lib/perl5);
use CGI qw(param);
use CGI::Carp qw(fatalsToBrowser);
use MyTemplate;
use Bank;

my $template = MyTemplate-&gt;new;
my $account_number = param( 'account_number' );

my ($account) = Bank::Account-&gt;search( account_number =&gt; $account_number );

$template-&gt;param( owners =&gt; join ', ', map { $_-&gt;first_name . " " . $_-&gt;last_name } $account-&gt;owners );

$template-&gt;param( account_number =&gt; $account_number,
                  balance =&gt; $account-&gt;get( 'balance' ) );

my @ATTRS = qw(transaction_date type amount new_balance);
my @transactions = map { my $t = $_; +{ map { $_, $t-&gt;$_ } @ATTRS } }
                       $account-&gt;transactions;
$template-&gt;param( transaction_loop =&gt; \@transactions );
print $template-&gt;html_output;</pre></div></div>
   <p>
    <img src="images/coderunner/save.gif"> Save it as <b>atm_choose.cgi</b>. Now click on 
    "Submit Query" in your browser after selecting one
    of the account numbers.  You'll see a familiar account statement, along with a
    form at the bottom that doesn't (yet) work.  Class::DBI has provided us with
    search methods that replace the need to write SQL.  We provided a
    method of our own, <b>type</b>, that follows the association to the
    transaction_type table to turn a transaction type id into a name.
    Because <b>Class::DBI</b> provides accessor convenience methods ($object-&gt;attr is
    short for $object-&gt;get( 'attr' ) ), we can seamlessly weave
    a call to that into the attribute fetches. (If you're wondering why
    there's a <b>+</b> sign before the hashref braces, this is one of those
    rare cases where Perl doesn't intuit the meaning we wanted if we just leave the braces bare.)
   </p>
   <p>
    Now, we're going to add the capability to perform timed withdrawals.  
    This requires us to convert the routine we created earlier, <b>add_transaction</b>, 
    a complex function that involved
    several SQL statements, to use Class::DBI. Create another new cgi file,
    the target of that form: </p>
 <div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO ENTER:</div><div class="listing"><pre>#!/usr/local/bin/perl

use MyTemplate;
use Date::Parse;
use Bank;

my $template = MyTemplate-&gt;new;
my %param = map { $_, param( $_ ) } qw(account_number type time amount);

my $time = str2time( $param{time} ) or die "Cannot parse '$param{time}'";
my $to_sleep = $time - time;
die "time is no good\n" if $to_sleep &lt; 0 || $to_sleep &gt; 3600;

$param{time} = localtime $time;
$template-&gt;param( %param );
print $template-&gt;html_output;

my ($account_number, $type, $amount) = @param{ qw(account_number type amount) };

  close STDIN;    # This prevents the web server from holding the
  close STDOUT;   # connection open the whole time we're sleeping
  close STDERR;
  sleep $to_sleep;

  my ($account) = Bank::Account-&gt;search( account_number =&gt; $account_number );
  my $balance = $account-&gt;get( 'balance' );
  my ($trans_type) = Bank::Transaction::Type-&gt;search( name =&gt; $type );
  my $new_balance = $balance + ($type eq 'credit' ? 1 : -1) * $amount;
  my $single_trans = Bank::Transaction::Single-&gt;insert( { amount =&gt; $amount,
                                     transaction_type =&gt; $trans_type,
                                     previous_balance =&gt; $balance,
                                     new_balance =&gt; $new_balance,
                                     } );
  Bank::Transactions-&gt;insert( { single_transaction =&gt; $single_trans,
                                account =&gt; $account } );
  $account-&gt;set( balance =&gt; $new_balance );
  exit;
}</pre></div></div>
   <p><img src="images/coderunner/save.gif"> 
    Save it as <b>atm_timed.cgi</b>; now enter a time a few minutes in the future 
    <i>according to our server—it is on Central Time—</i>and an amount in
    the timed transaction form.  Select <b>Credit</b> or <b>Debit</b> and click <b>Submit</b>.
    On the following page, click <b>Continue</b> to return to the statement page and
    verify that your transaction has not yet taken place.  Wait until the time
    you specified, then reload the page, and verify that it has happened.
    (You can specify the time to the nearest second if you like.)
   </p>
   <p>
    We close the standard streams in the child, otherwise the web server will
    see that they're still open and keep your browser waiting until the child has exited.
   </p>
   <p>
    Class::DBI provides insert and update (set) methods in
    addition to search. Class::DBI can take objects in lieu
    of values for columns it knows are related to another table.

    This type of web application framework is okay for small applications, but will 
    start to grate on you by the time you build very large ones. There are several frameworks 
    available in Perl that operate at higher abstraction levels and make those applications 
    easier. We haven't tackled them here because there's no clear front runner. 
    But if you're going to create large-scale web applications, you may want to look 
    into Catalyst, Dancer, CGI::Application, and Jifty. They embody varying levels of 
    complexity and capability.</p>

   <p>Perl people like to have fun! And I'm not just talking about OSCON parties involving 
    farm animals. (I'm not kidding! Randal Schwartz rented some alpacas for a 
    party celebrating the release of his "Intermediate Perl" book, which has an alpaca on the 
    front cover.) There are mailing lists devoted to fun with Perl, and also to the game of Perl 
    "golf" (solving a problem in the fewest number of characters—not recommended for

    people who know how to do serious large-scale work with Perl—the kind of work that

   <p>Perl started in 1987, but continues to be revitalized by the constant introduction of new features into Perl 5, which 
    necessitate the regular release of new editions of the best-selling O'Reilly book, "Learning Perl" (that one has a llama on it).
    On the horizon is Perl 6, a project ten years in the making, and a complete redesign of the language and its implementation.
    Non-backwards-compatible and based on the Parrot virtual machine architecture, Perl 6 offers some of the most advanced programming
    language capabilities ever.  When it is fully implemented, it promises to rock the computer world. Stay on top of its
    progress via <a href="http://www.perl6.org/" target="_blank">http://www.perl6.org/</a>.

 <p>And that's it! You have come to the end of not just the last lesson of this course, but the last course 
  in the Perl Certificate series. Congratulations, and thank you for choosing the O'Reilly School of 
  Technology to help you learn Perl! It's been a pleasure having you in the course. Good work and good luck!</p>
