 <p>Welcome back! In this lesson we're going to learn how to split a Perl program across multiple files. 
  Why would you want to do that? Mostly because you've written some code that can be <i>reused</i>, and rather 
  than copying and pasting it into every script, it usually makes more sense to maintain it in 
  only one place and then reference that place from those other scripts. (An important—perhaps the most 
  important—principle in good software development is known as <b>DRY</b>: <b>D</b>on't <b>R</b>epeat <b>Y</b>ourself. 
  The more duplication you eliminate from your code, the better and more maintainable it becomes.)</p>
 
 <p><div class="c"><img src="images/lessonImages/photoshop-textures-cracked-earth-2p.jpg" width="400">
 <br>Think DRY!</div></p>
 
 
 <p>At the beginning of each of the remaining lessons, we'll provide a linked list of the headings that the lesson contains, so you can 
  refer back to the major topics for review if you need to later. This lesson covers these topics:</p>
 
 <ul><li><a href="Perl4-02.html#require">require</a></li><li><a href="Perl4-02.html#use">use</a></li></ul>
 
 <a href="Perl4-02.html" name="require"></a>
 <a name="h_01"></a><div class="heading">require</div><div class="headingText">
  <a name="s_01"></a><div id="s_01"><div class="subheading"></div><div class="subheadingText">
   
   <p>The basic operation we'll use to accomplish our goal of splitting Perl programs across multiple files is
    <span class="purple">require</span>. (<span class="purple">require</span> calls a 
    lower-level function called <span class="purple">do</span>. You can look it up with <b>perldoc -f do</b>, if you feel the need.) </p>
    <p> The <span class="purple">require</span> statement comes 
    in several forms
   
   Let's say for this application that you're creating a calendar of events. (Ordinarily the calendar would 
    be stored in its own file, but for our purposes now, we'll just store the sample data after the source code.) 
    You have (wisely) decided to store the 
    date and time of each event as the <i>Unix time</i>, or the number of seconds past the <i>epoch</i> of 
    January 1, 1970, 00:00:00. This is a single number that can be passed around to several functions that accept 
    it, such as localtime, which will give us the opportunity to format the date for human consumption. (Go ahead and take a 
    look at <b>perldoc -f localtime</b> to refresh your memory.)</p>
 
   <p>Create <b>require.pl</b> in your <b>/perl4</b> folder as shown:</p>
   

<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO ENTER:</div><div class="listing"><pre>#!/usr/local/bin/perl

while ( &lt;DATA&gt; )
{

  my ($epoch, $event) = split /\s+/, $_, 2;
  my (undef, $min, $hour, $mday, $mon, $year) = localtime $epoch;
  my $i = 0;
  my %month_name = map { ++$i, $_ }
                       qw(Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec);
  printf "%02d-%s-%d %02d:%02d %s\n", $mday, $month_name{$mon},
         $year, $hour, $min, $event;

   <p>That took longer than we would have liked, yet the program is somewhat restrictive; it allows only 
    one format for the date, and if, when we expand this program later, we have any call to display the date 
    again, we'll have a lot of copying and pasting to do. Remember <b>DRY</b>! So let's encapsulate our hard-won

   <p>Here's how we did it:</p>
   
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: require.pl and the date_string subroutine</div><div class="observe"><pre>
  print date_string( $epoch, '<span class="purple">%d-%b-%y</span>' ), " $event\n"; 

sub date_string
{
  my ($epoch, <span class="purple">$format</span>) = @_;

  $format or warn "Using default format\n" and $format = "<span class="purple">%d-%b-%y</span>";
  my @names = qw(<span class="darkblue">S</span> M H d m y w Y I);
  my %part  = map { shift @names, $_ } <span class="darkgreen">localtime</span> $epoch;
  my $i = 0;
  my %month_name = map { ++$i, $_ }
                       qw(Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec);
  $part{m}++;
  <span class="darkred">$part{b}</span> = $month_name{ $part{m} };
  $part{y} += 1900;
  $_ = sprintf "%02d", $_ for @part{ qw(<span class="darkblue">S</span> M H d m) };
  <span class="purple">$format</span> =~ s/%([SMHdmywb])/$part{$1}/g;
  return <span class="purple">$format</span>;
} 
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p>Small changes to the program yield the date and time in many different possible combinations by 
    changing the specification string currently set to <span class="purple">'%d-%b-%y'</span>. That argument is parsed by 
    the <b>date_string</b> subroutine and used to determine how to format the date/time. Can you see how we built up a 
    hash with keys equal to each of the possible letters in the format string and values equal to the 
    corresponding value from <span class="darkgreen">localtime</span>? So $part{<span class="darkblue">S</span>}, for example, gets  
    set to the seconds value. And <span class="darkred">$part{b}</span> gets set to the abbreviated month name, so that 
    <span class="purple">%b</span> in the format string would get changed to, say, "Mar," by the substitution 
    near the end of <b>date_string</b>.</p>
   
   <p>(Our choice of format letters and the % character to introduce them is not entirely accidental. Look
    at the manual page for the <i>Unix system function</i> strftime by typing <b>man strftime</b> at your 
    shell prompt. Perl provides a way for you to call this function yourself through its <span class="blue">POSIX</span>
    module; type <b>perldoc POSIX</b> and search for 'strftime' in the output. You would, of course, be far 
    better off using that function than trying to extend our example here for production code.)</p>
   
   <p>But now, suppose we have other programs that want to do the same work as <b>date_string</b>. It might seem most efficient 
    to copy and paste the code, but with Perl, we want to practice <i>intelligent</i> lazinesss—it's a virtue by Perl's 
    standards (see <a href="http://threevirtues.com/" target="_blank">http://threevirtues.com/</a>). Cutting and pasting here 
    would mean that if we ever wanted to change the <b>date_string</b> function, we'd have to do it in all the places we'd pasted 
    it, one by one. So, in order to maximize laziness and deal with the same change only once, let's put it into a file of its own. 
    Create <b>date_lib.pl</b>:</p>
   

<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO ENTER:</div><div class="listing"><pre>sub date_string
{
  my ($epoch, $format) = @_;

  $format or warn "Using default format\n" and $format = "%d-%b-%y";
  my @names = qw(S M H d m y w Y I);
  my %part  = map { shift @names, $_ } localtime $epoch;
  my $i = 0;
  my %month_name = map { ++$i, $_ }
                       qw(Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec);

  $part{m}++;
  $part{b} = $month_name{ $part{m} };
  $part{y} += 1900;
  $_ = sprintf "%02d", $_ for @part{ qw(S M H d m) };
  $format =~ s/%([SMHdmywb])/$part{$1}/g;
  return $format;
}

   <p>And if you run <b>require.pl</b> again you'll find that it still works. That's because <b>require.pl</b> now finds

  <p><b>require</b> has many uses in Perl programs, but there is a slightly more complicated command 
   that's <i>based upon</i> <span class="darkgreen">require</span> that you'll use more often. We'll learn about 
   that next!</p>

   <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.png"> and run <i>that</i> program, and see what it says 
    about John Smith!</p>
   
   <p>When Perl runs your program, first it reads all of the code and <i>compiles</i> it to an internal, 
    efficient code. Unlike in languages like C and Java, Perl doesn't 
    output that code for you to save into an executable. (It's not really possible either, for a variety 
    of esoteric reasons; but Perl generates that code so incredibly fast that it doesn't matter.) Then Perl 
    executes that internal code.</p>
   
   <p>This is why Perl allows <i>forward references</i> (calls to subroutines that haven't been defined yet). 
    Perl doesn't try to execute those calls until it's read the whole program, by which time, of course, it's 
    seen and compiled the subroutines being called. Putting code in a BEGIN block tells Perl to run it as soon 
    as it's been compiled, even before any more code has been read. Take a look at what happens if you introduce a syntax 
    error. Modify your code as shown: </p>

   <p>You'll notice two things: (1) We are feeding a <i>bareword</i> (that's official Perl terminology) to 
    <b>require</b> instead of a string; (2) Perl does something special with it, looking for a file whose name 
    ends in <b>.pm</b>.</p>
   
   <p>This is a special property of <b>require</b>: when its argument is a bareword, it looks for a file 
    with the same name as the bareword, but with <b>.pm</b> on the end. This is the only 
    time that filename extensions are truly important to Perl.</p>
   
   <p>The <b>pm</b> stands for "Perl Module," and <i>modules</i> are what it's all about in this course! We'll get 
    into the specific definition of a module later. </p>
   
   <p>For now, let's give Perl what it's looking for by copying <b>date_lib.pl</b> to <b>DateLib.pm</b>: </p>

   <p>This is because the <b>import</b> subroutine is now defined in the wrong package: it's still
