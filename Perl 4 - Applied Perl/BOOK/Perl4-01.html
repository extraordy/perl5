  <p>
   If we haven't already met, please allow me to introduce myself. My name is Peter Scott, and I am the author of the 
   books "Perl Debugged," "Perl Medic," and the DVD "Perl Fundamentals," as well as the previous three courses in 
   this series. Throughout this course, you'll have the guidance of your OST instructor. If you 
   find any part of any lesson to be confusing, ambiguous, or 
   incorrect, please let your instructor know so we can fix it.</p>
  </div>
 
    <p>Perl 4: Applied Perl teaches the application of Perl in performing many common complex tasks. You will not only learn 
    how to use objects in Perl, but also how to make your own, so that you, too, can create reusable code (aka modules). We'll 
    cover the basics of object-oriented programming in Perl, plus more advanced aspects such as inheritance, polymorphism, 
    inside-out objects, and use of the Moose O-O system.</p>

   <p>Also, because some of the modules we will need do not come with the standard Perl distribution, we'll show you how to get 
   any module you want from the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network. All this, plus multiprocessing in Perl and using its 
   built-in debugger, awaits you in Perl 4.</p>
    
 <a name="h_01"></a><div class="heading">Learning with O'Reilly School of Technology Courses</div><div class="headingText">  
  <p>As with every O'Reilly School of Technology course, we'll take a <i>user-active</i> 
    approach to learning. This means that you (the user) will be active! You'll learn by doing,  
    building live programs, testing them and experimenting with them—hands-on!</p>
  
  <p>To learn a new skill or technology, you have to experiment. The more you experiment, the more 
    you learn. Our system is designed to maximize experimentation and help you <i>learn to 
      learn</i> a new skill.</p>
  
  <p>We'll program as much as possible to be sure that the principles sink in and stay with you.</p>
  
  <p>Each time we discuss a new concept, you'll put it into code and see what YOU can do with it.  
   On occasion we'll even give you code that doesn't work, so you can see common mistakes and how 
   to recover from them. Making mistakes is actually another good way to learn.</p>  
    
  <p>Above all, we want to help you to <i>learn to learn</i>. We give you the tools to take control 
    of your own learning experience. </p>

  <p>When you complete an OST course, you know the subject matter, <i>and</i> you know how to 
    expand your knowledge, so you can handle changes like software and operating system updates.</p>
   
   <p>Here are some tips for using O'Reilly School of Technology courses effectively:</p>

  <ul><li><b>Type the code.</b> Resist the temptation to cut and paste the example code we give you. 
    Typing the code  
      actually gives you a feel for the programming task. Then play around with the examples to find out what 
      else you can make them do, and to check your understanding. It's highly
      unlikely you'll break anything by experimentation. If you <i>do</i> break something, that's an indication to us that 
      we need to improve our system!</li><li><b>Take your time.</b> Learning takes time. Rushing can have negative effects on your 
      progress. Slow down and let your brain absorb the new information thoroughly. 
      Taking your time helps to maintain a relaxed, positive approach. It also gives you the 
      chance to try new things and learn more than you otherwise would if you blew 
      through all of the coursework too quickly.</li><li><b>Experiment.</b> Wander from the path often and explore the possibilities. We can't 
      anticipate all of your questions and ideas, so it's up to you to experiment and create on 
      your own. Your instructor will help if you go completely off the rails.</li><li><b>Accept guidance, but don't depend on it.</b> Try to solve problems on your own. Going 
      from misunderstanding to understanding is the best way to acquire a new skill. Part of what 
      you're learning is problem solving. Of course, you can always contact your instructor 
      for hints when you need them.</li><li><b>Use all available resources!</b> In real-life problem-solving, you aren't bound by false 
      limitations; in OST courses, you are free to use any resources at your disposal to solve
      problems you encounter: the Internet, reference books, and online help are all fair game.   
      </li><li><b>Have fun!</b> Relax, keep practicing, and don't be afraid to make mistakes! 
      Your instructor will keep you at it until you've 
      mastered the skill. We want you to get that satisfied, "I'm so cool! I did it!"
      feeling. And you'll have some projects to show off when you're done.</li></ul>
  </div>   
 <a name="h_01"></a><div class="heading">Lesson Format</div><div class="headingText">
        
    <p>We'll try out lots of examples in each lesson. We'll have you write code, 
    look at code, and edit existing code. The code will be presented in boxes that will 
    indicate what needs to be done to the code inside.</p>
        
    <p>Whenever you see white boxes like the one below, you'll <i>type</i> the contents into the editor window to try the example yourself. 
      The CODE TO TYPE bar on top of the white box contains directions for you to follow:</p>
        
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE:</div><div class="listing"><pre>White boxes like this contain code for you to try out (type into a file to run).

If you have already written some of the code, new code for you to add <ins>looks like this</ins>. 
    
If we want you to remove existing code, the code to remove <del>will look like this</del>.
  
<span class="gray">We may also include instructive comments that you don't need to type.</span>  
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p>We may run programs and do some other activities in a terminal session in the operating system or other command-line environment. These will be shown 
     like this:</p>
   
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>
The plain black text that we present in these INTERACTIVE boxes is 
provided by the system (not for you to type). The commands we want you to type <ins>look like this</ins>.
</pre></div></div>   
        
  <p>Code and information presented in a gray OBSERVE box is for you to <i>inspect</i> and <i>absorb</i>. 
  This information is often color-coded, and followed by text explaining the code in detail:</p>
        
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE:</div><div class="observe"><pre>
Gray "Observe" boxes like this contain <span class="darkred">information</span> (usually code specifics) for you to <i>observe</i>.
</pre></div></div>

   <p>The paragraph(s) that follow may provide addition details on <span class="darkred">information</span> that was 
     highlighted in the Observe box.</p>
   
   <p>We'll also set especially pertinent information apart in "Note" boxes:</p>      
   
   <p><div class="c"><table class="noteBox fBox pBox "><tr><td class="noteTitle">Note</td><td class="note">Notes provide information that is useful, but not absolutely necessary for performing the tasks at hand.</td></tr></table></div> </p>
   
   <p><div class="c"><table class="noteBox fBox pBox "><tr><td class="noteTitle">Tip</td><td class="note">Tips provide information that might help make the tools easier for you to use, such as shortcut keys.</td></tr></table></div></p>
   
   <p><div class="c"><table class="noteBox fBox pBox "><tr><td class="noteTitle">WARNING</td><td class="note">Warnings provide information that can help prevent program crashes and data loss.</td></tr></table></div></p>

 <a name="h_02"></a><div class="heading">Retrospective</div><div class="headingText">
   
   <p>The courses preceding this one in the Perl Series were:</p>
   
   <ul><li><b>Beginning Perl</b> — Introduced the language, its basic data types, operators, and 
     block-structured syntax: conditionals, loops, and subroutines. </li><li><b>Intermediate Perl</b> — Covered regular expressions, dealing with files, processing directories, and 
     syntax and functions in greater depth.</li><li><b>Advanced Perl</b> — Introduced references to both data and code; also covered hierarchical data structures,
     exceptions, list processing, system interaction, command line options, and regular expressions in 
     greater depth.</li></ul>
   
   <p>You can probably tell by looking over the content from those earlier courses, as progress in Perl, 
     we cover ground faster. 
     This course continues that trend, so hold on—we are about to hit the accelerator!</p>
  
  </div>
  <a name="h_03"></a><div class="heading">Overview</div><div class="headingText">
   
   <p>From here, there are many directions we <i>could</i> go to gain a deeper understanding of Perl: the 
    symbol table, features added to Perl from version 5.8 onward, functional programming, or any of a number of 
    features of regular expressions. But we're not going to do any of those things, because at this point 
    you're advanced enough to research and learn those topics on your 
    own whenever you need them.</p>
   
   <p>Instead, we'll develop <i>applied</i> Perl programming. We'll learn how to do many common and useful tasks 
    from inside Perl, following, as always, best practices. We will send email, query databases, 
    and write programs for the World Wide Web. The generic key to all of these tasks is a <i>module</i>: a parcel 
    of reusable code that your program can use <i>when you load it.</i> Some of the modules we'll use come with 
    the standard Perl distribution; some of them need to be downloaded from the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network
    (CPAN). We'll go over how to do that in a bit.</p>
   
   <p>But first, because modules are <i>object-oriented,</i> we'll spend some time learning how object-oriented 
    programming in Perl works, and how to create our own object classes so we can create our own modules. </p>
   
   <p>We'll be covering many topics in this course, but none of them in exhaustive depth. 
    You'll have plenty of opportunity to sharpen your skills in any specific areas you choose, independently. We'll give you 
    pointers on doing just that. So if, for instance, you find that you really need to work on 
    database programming in depth, you'll know how to go out and retrieve the tools you need to do it.</p>
 
 </div>
 <a name="h_04"></a><div class="heading">Review</div><div class="headingText">
      
  <p>Because we have so much information to pack in here, it's <i>vital</i> that you're up to speed with the required 
   level of Perl expertise. We assume that you have taken the three previous courses in this series, or have 
   equivalent experience. For the benefit of people who haven't taken those courses, we're going to spend a short 
   amount of time on a review of the necessary skills and knowledge, so you can tell whether you have them. If by 
   the end of this section you do not feel completely confident in proceeding, contact us at 
   <a href="mailto:info@oreillyschool.com">info@oreillyschool.com</a> so we can have a conversation about 
   transferring your tuition to an earlier course. It won't serve you well to try to keep up with a course that 
   you're not quite ready to tackle, so please pay special attention to what comes next.</p>
  
  <p>If you have completed the previous three Perl courses to your own satisfaction, you can 
   <a href="Perl4-01.html#Packages">skip to the next section</a>, but you might want to read this section anyway; you can 
   never be too well-versed in the fundamentals!</p>

   <p>We'll go over parts of the code together, but you should be able to understand 
    all of it on your own, even if it takes a while. This code creates text files of stock data (when given the 
    <span class="code">-a</span> option), edits those files (with the <span class="code">-r</span> option), and  
    reads those files and prints subsets of them according to search criteria. </p>
   
   <p>It forms an <i>internal representation</i> of those text files in a data structure that is a hash pointed 
     to by <b>$data_ref</b>, a variable that is scoped only to the subroutines <b>add_item()</b>, <b>remove_items()</b>, 
     <b>subset_data()</b>, <b>load_data()</b>, and <b>subset_data()</b> (and so they are <i>closed over</i> <b>$data_ref</b>). Each 
    entry in the hash is keyed off a stock symbol, and each entry is itself a reference to a hash with a key that is 
    a date and a value that is a reference to an array of the high, low, and closing values. Graphically, part 
    of that data structure might look like this:</p>
   
   <p><div class="c"><img src="images/lessonImages/review.png"></div></p>
    
    <p>Let's look at the <b>subset_data()</b> subroutine, which is used to form a hash of just the data referenced by 
    a particular symbol and/or a particular date or range of dates separated by a colon:</p>
   
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: subset_data() subroutine</div><div class="observe"><pre>
  sub subset_data
  {
    my (<span class="darkblue">$symbol</span>, <span class="darkblue">$date</span>) = @_;
</pre></div></div>

   <p>Extract the arguments to the subroutine into $symbol and $date (if either one is not specified, its value will be <i>undef</i>).</p>
     
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: subset_data() subroutine</div><div class="observe"><pre>
    my <span class="darkred">$this_ref</span>;
</pre></div></div>
    
   <p><span class="darkred">$this_ref</span> is the reference to the hash we will form that contains a copy of the data in 
    the master data structure <span class="darkgreen">$data_ref</span>, with the subsets <span class="darkblue">$symbol</span> and/or 
    <span class="darkblue">$date</span>.</p>
     
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: subset_data() subroutine</div><div class="observe"><pre>
    if ( <span class="darkblue">$symbol</span> )
    {
      <span class="darkred">$this_ref</span>-&gt;{<span class="darkblue">$symbol</span>} = <span class="darkgreen">$data_ref</span>-&gt;{<span class="darkblue">$symbol</span>};
    }
</pre></div></div>
    
   <p>If <span class="darkblue">$symbol</span> is supplied, it will have a true value (we don't have to worry about the 
    digit zero as a possibility because there can be no such stock symbol), and so we set 
    <span class="darkred">$this_ref</span> to that part of <span class="darkgreen">$data_ref</span> containing only 
    <span class="darkblue">$symbol</span>'s data. </p>
     
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: subset_data() subroutine</div><div class="observe"><pre>
    else
    {
      <span class="darkred">$this_ref</span> = { %<span class="darkgreen">$data_ref</span> };
    }
</pre></div></div>
    
   <p>If no <span class="darkblue">$symbol</span> is supplied, we have to set <span class="darkred">$this_ref</span> to be a copy of 
    the whole data set so that we can subset it by date in the following lines. We can't just say 
    <span class="code"><span class="darkred">$this_ref</span> = <span class="darkgreen">$data_ref</span></span>. If we did that, when we attempt to 
    manipulate <span class="darkred">$this_ref</span>, we would actually be changing the hash pointed to by 
    <span class="darkgreen">$data_ref</span>.</p>
     
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: subset_data() subroutine</div><div class="observe"><pre>
    if ( <span class="darkblue">$date</span> )
    {
      for my <span class="darkblue">$symbol</span> ( keys %<span class="darkred">$this_ref</span> )
      {
</pre></div></div>
    
   <p>Now we're subsetting by date, so we go through each of the second-level hashes and determine which
     of their dates to keep:</p>
   
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: subset_data() subroutine</div><div class="observe"><pre>
	    my ($from, $to)      = date_to_range( <span class="darkblue">$date</span> );
</pre></div></div>
    
   <p><span class="darkblue">$date</span> may contain a single date, like 2011-03-09, or a date range, like 
    2011-03-09:2011-03-22, but <span class="darkgreen">date_to_range()</span> will return a list in either 
    case. If it's a single date, <span class="red">$from</span> and <span class="red">$to</span> will be equal to one another.</p> 
     
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: subset_data() subroutine</div><div class="observe"><pre>
	    my @dates            = grep { $_ ge $from &amp;&amp; $_ le $to }
	                                keys %{ <span class="darkred">$this_ref</span>-&gt;{<span class="darkblue">$symbol</span>} };
</pre></div></div>
    
   <p>This expression selects date ranges: it finds the keys (dates) in the current second-level hash 
    that are between the required dates. Because we order our dates as YYYY-MM-DD and use leading zeros
    on the month and day, this string comparison works without the need for parsing dates.</p>
   
    <div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: subset_data() subroutine</div><div class="observe"><pre>
	<span class="darkred">$this_ref</span>-&gt;{<span class="darkblue">$symbol</span>} = { map { $_, <span class="darkred">$this_ref</span>-&gt;{<span class="darkblue">$symbol</span>}{$_} } @dates };
      }
</pre></div></div>
    
   <p>Having found the dates we need, we repopulate the second-level hash with the <i>anonymous hash ref</i>
     (the outer braces to the right of the equals sign) containing the hash that has the (key, value) pair of the
     (date, innermost-hash value) for each of those dates.</p>
   
    <div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: subset_data() subroutine</div><div class="observe"><pre>
    }
    return <span class="darkred">$this_ref</span>;
  }
</pre></div></div>
    
   <p>Finally, we return the reference to the data structure we've created.</p>
     
   <p>The code uses lots of <i>hash slices:</i> subsets of the values of a hash formed with a 
     construct like <span class="code">@hash{<i>list of keys</i>}</span>.  Can you find them all?</p>
   
   <p>This code isn't designed to be an optimal solution to the problem it's solving. We're using it to 
     illustrate a number of review concepts and make sure that you're familiar with the necessary material. 
     For instance, the line:</p>
    
    <div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: Fragment</div><div class="observe"><pre>
( <span class="darkred">$opt{r}</span> ? \&amp;remove_items : \&amp;display_items )<span class="darkblue">-&gt;</span>( <span class="darkgreen">@opt{ qw(s d) }</span> );
</pre></div></div>
    
    <p>...might be succinct, but it's a poor way to choose between two subroutines. Its purpose here is 
      to demonstrate an idiom using code references. Can you see how it works? The trinary operator picks 
      one of two code references depending on the value of <span class="darkred">$opt{r}</span>; that code reference
      is called using the <span class="darkblue">-&gt;</span> arrow operator, passing the values of 
      <span class="darkgreen">$opt{s}</span> and <span class="darkgreen">$opt{d}</span>.</p>
    
    <p>Hopefully you're questioning the design of the entire program: 
      It's not maintainable with respect to extending or changing the user 
      interface, the data structure is not self-explanatory (ask yourself how well you would understand it 
      without the diagram above), and there is more data copying and passing to subroutines than we would 
      like. <i>Object-oriented programming</i> was designed to address these kinds of problems. So let's get busy and learn to remedy them!</p>
   
  </div></div>
 </div>
 <a href="Perl4-01.html" name="Packages"></a>
 <a name="h_05"></a><div class="heading">Packages</div><div class="headingText">
  
   <p>Objects rely on <i>namespaces,</i> so we'll start there. We'll begin by exploring <i>packages</i>,
      an aspect of Perl that has been around since before
     version 5 was released in 1994. So far in this course series, the variables that you've learned to use are 
     <i>lexical</i> variables, declared with the <span class="purple">my</span> keyword:</p>
  
   <div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: my</div><div class="observe"><pre>
<span class="purple">my</span> $pooch;
<span class="purple">my</span> (@puppies, %litter_mate);
for <span class="purple">my</span> $breed ( keys %breeders ) { ... }
</pre></div></div>
  
   <p>But like some shadow universe existing alongside our own, there is a completely different space of 
     variables in Perl where variables can exist: these are the <i>package</i> or <i>dynamic</i> 
     variables. Lexical variables were introduced into Perl with version 5 and their behavior is so 
     conducive to safe programming that best practice is to use <i>only</i> lexical variables wherever 
     possible. If you were to look at a Perl program written before 1994 (or one written afterward by 
     someone who wanted to stick to the old rules—there are many such programs and 
     programmers around still), you would see variables that weren't declared with <span class="purple">my</span>, 
     yet the programs still work. That's because:</p>
  
   <ul><li>When you don't declare a variable with <span class="purple">my</span>, Perl interprets it as a package 
       variable. </li><li>Those programs don't <b>use strict</b>, which causes Perl to object if you use a package variable 
       <i>unless you take special precautions</i>. </li></ul>
  
  <a name="s_01"></a><div id="s_01"><div class="subheading">Declaring Package Variables</div><div class="subheadingText">
   
    <p>We mentioned <i>special precautions</i> above; the way we take those precautions is that whenever we refer to a package 
      variable, we explicitly declare which package it is in, by putting the name of the package between the <i>sigil</i> 
      (the <span class="darkblue">$</span>, <span class="darkblue">@</span>, <span class="darkblue">%</span>, etc), and the rest of 
      the variable name, separated by two colons, like this:</p>
   
    <div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: Package Variables</div><div class="observe"><pre>
    <span class="darkblue">$</span><span class="darkred">Dog</span>::schnauzer
    <span class="darkblue">@</span><span class="darkred">Cat</span>::breeds
    <span class="darkblue">%</span><span class="darkred">Filehandles</span>::zipcode_input
</pre></div></div>
   
    <p>The package names in our example are <span class="darkred">Dog</span>, <span class="darkred">Cat</span>, and 
      <span class="darkred">Filehandles</span>, respectively. A package can be named anything you want; its purpose is 
      to create a new namespace so that you can refer to, for example, 
      <b>$<span class="darkred">HusbandAccount</span>::balance</b> and <b>$<span class="darkred">WifeAccount</span>::balance</b> 
      as two completely different variables. You don't have to do anything to declare a package; it comes 
      into existence automatically as soon as you refer to it in a variable name.</p>
   
    <p>We're still going to use lexical variables wherever 
      possible, but learning about package variables first will help us as we learn about packages. Let's try this example; create
      <b>package.pl</b> in your <b>/perl4</b> folder like this:</p>
   
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE:</div><div class="listing"><pre>
#!/usr/local/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

my $lexical = "Outer lexical variable";
{
  my $lexical = "Inner lexical variable";
  $main::package = "This is a package variable";
  my_sub();
}

sub my_sub
{
  print "\$lexical       = $lexical\n";
  print "\$main::package = $main::package\n";
}
</pre></div></div>
   
    <p>Save and run that program.  You'll see this:</p>

cold:~/perl4$ <ins>./package.pl</ins>
$lexical       = Outer lexical variable
$main::package = This is a package variable
    </pre></div></div>

    <p>The <b>$lexical</b> declared and assigned inside the naked block ("inner lexical variable") is 
      not the one printed from <b>mysub()</b>, because that variable isn't in scope by then. But 
      <b>$main::package</b> <i>is</i> visible from <b>mysub()</b>, because it is always in scope.</p>

  <a name="s_02"></a><div id="s_02"><div class="subheading">package, our</div><div class="subheadingText">
   
    <p>Perl has a special keyword, <span class="purple">our</span>, designed to make it easier to refer to package 
      variables. It's just like <b>my</b>, except it refers to <i>package</i> variables. Okay, if that sounds 
      weird, just bear with me. Perl features a <i>current package:</i> you can set it with the 
      keyword <b>package</b>. When you declare a variable with <span class="purple">our</span>, it means you can 
      refer to that variable in the <i>current package</i> by its name without the package, until the end 
      of the current <i>lexical</i> scope. The <i>variable</i> will still exist after that scope, but you 
      can only refer to it by the package-less name <i>within that scope.</i> It'll be easier to understand using an

    <p>So from an <span class="purple">our</span> statement until the end of the current lexical scope, the

    <p>If you look only at the lines that call <b>print_report()</b>, it doesn't seem quite right that <b>@ints</b>

      leap out at you. The problem is that the <span class="purple">while</span> loop in <b>print_report()</b> sets <span class="red">$_</span>

    <p><img src="images/coderunner/checksyntax.png"> and run it and you will get exactly the same output as before. We 
      just changed the way we get it. We want to take advantage of the magic <span class="blue">&lt;&gt;</span> operator, 
      which requires one or more filenames in <b>@ARGV</b>, but good programming practice demands that we do not 
      stomp all over the value of <b>@ARGV</b> for the rest of the program. By <i>localizing</i> our assignment,

   <p>We've already used package variables in a few places, probably without your knowledge. One instance 
     was during sorting, for instance, when you use <span class="darkred">$a</span> and <span class="darkred">$b</span> in a 
     <span class="darkgreen">sort</span> comparison block, like this: </p>

   <div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: sort</div><div class="observe"><pre>
@sorted = <span class="darkgreen">sort</span> { <span class="darkred">$a</span> &lt;=&gt; <span class="darkred">$b</span> } @numbers
</pre></div></div>
  
   <p>Even though you have not declared <span class="darkred">$a</span> or <span class="darkred">$b</span>, there is no 
     objection from Perl; they are package variables in that case, but <span class="blue">use strict</span> makes a special 
     exception only for the variables named <span class="darkred">$a</span> and <span class="darkred">$b</span>.</p>
  
   <p>But by far the most common use we've made so far of package variables has been as <i>subroutines</i>. You may not think 
     of subroutine as a variable, but it has to live <i>somewhere</i>, and that place is in a package.</p>

     subroutines live inside packages is <i>crucial</i> to developing excellent object-oriented programming skills.</p>
